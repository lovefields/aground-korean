		<text id="homeworld1">Excellent, with so few of us left, we have to stick together!</text>
		<text id="homeworld2">I’ll head there now, I’ll bet they could use someone who knows a thing or two about plants!</text>
		<text id="introduce1">Boy am I glad to see you. Here I was thinkin’ I was all alone, just one old man in an empty world.</text>
		<text id="introduce2">I still got some life in these old bones and I reckon I could help you out. Farming’s my trade, and we all need some good food to keep us going.</text>
		<text id="introduce3">How about we build a barn and get a [color=770000]Farm[/color] up and runnin’?</text>
		<text id="farm1">Nice! I'll put up the barn and plant some [item=wheat_seed]!</text>
		<text id="farm2">Now we have a [color=770000]Farm[/color]! Stop by on occasion to pick up growin' crops - they will help restore your [tile=stamina] [color=006600]Stamina[/color]. Here - take some [item=bread] to keep you going while it grows.</text>
		<text id="farm3">You can get [item=wood] by chopping down trees.</text>
		<text id="farm4">If you want to grow more, simply plant more seeds! You can also manage and remove existing crops at the barn!</text>
		<text id="farm5">Look at our awesome [color=770000]Farm[/color]! It's as good as anything I used to grow back home! But if you want to grow more, I can always make more seeds.</text>
		<text id="kitchen">Raw [item=wheat] isn’t very tasty, but I bet we could make something better if you and the [object=builder] made a [color=770000]Kitchen[/color].</text>
		<text id="pen1">You know what this [color=770000]Farm[/color] needs? Some Livestock! How about capturing some [color=770000][tile=boar] Boars[/color] with a [item=net]?</text>
		<text id="pen2">I’ll add a [color=770000]Pen[/color] for [var=quest.pen.pig] [item=pig]s and [var=quest.pen.wood] [item=wood].</text>
		<text id="pen3">Now aren't those the fattest and juiciest looking [item=pig]s you've ever seen?</text>
		<text id="pen4">With the pen, we can now produce [item=meat] and [item=milk]!</text>
		<text id="pen5">If you want to build more [color=770000]Pen[/color]s, use the [item=pen_blueprint].</text>
		<text id="pig">How do you get a [item=pig]? Lay a [item=net] on the ground and then lure a wounded [color=770000][tile=boar] Boar[/color] onto it, and if you're lucky, it’ll be caught and domesticated!</text>
		<text id="kitchen2">Milking a [item=pig]? Why not? This is a strange land. But what we could really use is some [item=cheese] - talk to the [object=builder] about improving the [color=770000]Kitchen[/color].</text>
		<text id="halloween">I hope you don't mind, but I did a little decoratin' for the Harvest Festival! We could use a little celebrating around here. I also put some [item=jakolantern]s in the [color=770000]Storehouse[/color].</text>
		<text id="add_sugar">This farm is getting pretty big! To celebrate I found some [item=sugar_seed]! Try planting a field of [item=sugar]!</text>
		<text id="add_cotton">I met a few traders by the [color=770000]Dock[/color] and got some [item=cotton_seed]!</text>
		<text id="orchard1">There are a lot of [item=fruit] around here. With enough seeds, I could probably plant a nice [color=770000]Orchard[/color]!</text>
		<text id="orchard2">Great, with this many [item=fruit] we have enough [item=orchard_seed] to plant an [color=770000]Orchard[/color]!</text>
		<text id="orchard3">Let me know when you have enough [item=fruit] for the [color=770000]Orchard[/color]!</text>
		<text id="orchard4">Seeds can be planted on grass tiles as long as there is enough empty space to place them. Let me know where you want to plant the [item=orchard_seed]!</text>
		<text id="orchard5">You can also use seeds to change crops in the [color=770000]Barn[/color]. If you want to make new seeds, just let me know!</text>
		<text id="snowman">The first snowfall is here! That makes it as good a time as any to celebrate! I even made a magic [item=snowman] from [item=ice_berries], I hope you like it!</text>
		<text id="sign1">This place is starting to feel like home, ain't it? How about giving the place a name?</text>

		<text id="smelter1">This is the stuff. I should have a [color=770000]Smelter[/color] up in no time!</text>
		<text id="smelter2">The [color=770000]Smelter[/color] can turn raw ores into bars. It requires fuel to melt them down, but luckily there is plenty of [item=coal] around to keep it running.</text>
		<text id="hint1">Well, what are you waiting for? Just hold [key=down] to dig down and find those ores!</text>
		<text id="hint2">Ore is heavy - make sure to drop them off in the [color=770000]Storehouse[/color] between trips.</text>

		<text id="hint6">I can make [item=torch]es if you need some.</text>
		<text id="workshop1">How about a [color=770000]Workshop[/color] to turn those metal bars into tools? I can make one for [var=quest.workshop.iron_bar] [item=iron_bar]s and [var=quest.workshop.wood] [item=wood].</text>
		<text id="workshop2">Alright, let's get this [color=770000]Workshop[/color] set up!</text>
		<text id="workshop3">At the [color=770000]Workshop[/color], you can instantly create any tools or items that you have the ingredients to make.</text>

		<text id="torch">[item=iron] is pretty deep underground, so take a [item=torch] to help you see. If this one burns out, talk to me and I can make more.</text>
		<text id="smelter3">Once you have enough [item=iron], select [item=iron_bar] from the [color=770000]Smelter[/color] menu, and it will automatically smelt as long as there is fuel remaining.</text>
		<text id="smelter4">You can add as many jobs to the [color=770000]Smelter[/color] as you have ingredients for, and it will smelt them one by one while you are away as long as it has fuel.</text>

		<text id="introduce3">Traders? There are more survivors out there?</text>

		<text id="introduce5">You’re going to charge us when you were just caught stealing?!</text>
		<text id="introduce6">That was that. This is business. My offer is [var=quest.market.gold_bar] [item=gold_bar]s to add this island to the trade route.</text>

		<text id="market1">Perfect! I feel this is the beginning of many lucrative trades between us.</text>

		<text id="east1">What have we done? Now they will return, and unless we do something soon, we will all die.</text>
		<text id="east2">Our only hope is to learn more about their magic, either to be powerful enough to defeat them or to find their weaknesses.</text>
		<text id="east3">For now, we have two clues. One is the evolution chamber the Old One left behind. It can’t be a coincidence it was hiding it.</text>
		<text id="east4">Now that the Old One’s strong magical signal is gone, I’m detecting another signal away to the east. There must be another island with even more secrets hidden than this one!</text>
		<text id="east5">I almost thought the Alchemist might just be here. But no. Of course not…</text>
		<text id="east6">It looks like he left a note: “The secrets of magic must lie further east…”</text>
		<text id="east7">He didn’t give me a lot to work with. But, it’s a start - I should go east, and try to learn more about that weird chamber that appeared when the Old One died.</text>
		<text id="east8">I have learned everything I can here. I will return to the laboratory to see if I can uncover anything else before they return...</text>
		<text id="return_lab">I think we've learned everything we can on this island. I will return to my laboratory and see if I can uncover anything else using what we learned here...</text>
		<text id="spellbook1">Some fish taught you how to write down spells as spellbooks? That is incredible! Let me try to make one myself!</text>
		<text id="spellbook2">It worked! Here, try this [item=heal_book]! I also wrote down the recipe if you want to make more at the fish library!</text>
		<text id="bombardment1">Ah, welcome! I have restored this cave's enchantment and brought the others here, it is now the perfect hiding place.</text>
		<text id="bombardment2">I sheltered in this cave for years the last time they were hunting for me. It is quite safe.</text>
		<text id="bombardment3">But, unless we want to wait for them to give up thinking we are dead or fled, we must continue our research and gain enough magical power to destroy them!</text>
		<text id="bombardment4">Here, take these [tile=blueprint.ico] [color=770000]Blueprint[/color]s, they may aid you in our quest!</text>
		<text id="evo_chamber">Strange... this structure appeared when the [color=770000]Old One[/color] died... I wonder what it does?</text>
		<text id="brilliant_potion1">I have been studying the ancient carvings, looking for new potion recipes... and the strangest thing happened! A new recipe that wasn't there yesterday suddenly appeared on the stones!</text>
		<text id="brilliant_potion2">It must be special, it's even called a [item=brilliant_potion]. We must make it at once!</text>
		<text id="brilliant_potion3">I have made the potion - but I still have no idea what it does. You might as well drink it and find out!</text>
		<text id="brilliant_potion4">I also added the recipe to the lab if you want to make more.</text>
		<text id="brilliant_potion5">I feel strange... my entire body is tingling... the potion must have done something...</text>
		<text id="carapace1">It is done! I have thoroughly studied the carapace armor protecting the enemy, and have designed a [item=carapace_armor] that can fit humans!</text>
		<text id="carapace2">I think you will agree that it was well worth the wait! The recipe has been added to the [color=770000]Laboratory[/color]! If it gets damaged, you can repair it with [item=blood_gem]s.</text>
		<text id="carapace3">What? You thought I'd just be here muttering about nested carapace forever?</text>
		<text id="win1">They are defeated? Then I can continue my magic research on this planet unimpeded!</text>
		<text id="win2">That is good to hear. But, I will stay here. There are still many secrets of magic to uncover, and after being here so long, I can’t imagine leaving this planet.</text>
		<text id="win3">You have done it?! You have finally defeated them? I hope you made good use of the magic secrets we discovered!</text>
		<text id="win4">They have caused such pain and death… my fellow scouts will never return… but, at least those magic-hoarding tentacle monsters will never again hurt anyone.</text>
		<text id="introduce1">There is more to this planet than meets the eye. I have been doing experiments, and I believe I have discovered magic!</text>
		<text id="introduce2">I am in need of more materials. If you come across a [item=wyrm], slay it and give me its [item=dragonblood] and I will make sure you are rewarded.</text>
		<text id="lab1">I knew it! This is the secret! I must set up a laboratory immediately!</text>
		<text id="lab2">Your reward? Bring materials to my lab and I will mix up a magic potion for you.</text>
		<text id="lab3">Hurry up! My research is at a standstill until I get some [item=dragonblood]!</text>
		<text id="pen1">I need more [item=dragonblood]! Bring me [var=quest.wyrm_pen.wyrm] live [item=wyrm]s and we'll have an endless supply of [item=dragonblood] to experiment with!</text>
		<text id="pen2">Excellent! Stand back while I work my magic!</text>
		<text id="pen3">Behold my brilliant invention - the [color=770000]Wyrm Pen[/color]! It's more than just a pen, it's an endless supply of [item=dragonblood]!</text>
		<text id="wyrm">I bet you could capture a [item=wyrm] with a [item=net] if it was heavily wounded. But you must catch it alive!</text>
		<text id="dragon1">We must experiment more on the [item=wyrm]s! What do they eat? Why do they give [item=dragonblood]? You must feed the [item=wyrm]s in the [color=770000]Wyrm Pen[/color] to find out more about their evolution!</text>
		<text id="dragon2">I knew it! The [item=wyrm]s metamorphosize into [item=dragon]s! But then why are there so few [item=adult_dragon]s in this land?</text>
		<text id="dragon3">I believe there is a dragon lair somewhere in the mountain. If you find it, summon me... perhaps some of these secrets can be discovered there.</text>
		<text id="dragon4">Ah, an [item=adult_dragon]! Let's see what she has to say - I can translate for you with a simple spell.</text>
		<text id="dragon5">Who are you, to awaken me from my slumber?</text>
		<text id="dragon6">I am a seeker of truth and magic. Tell me - why are there so few dragons left in this world?</text>
		<text id="dragon7">Because the old ones left. They too were seekers of truth and magic. And they betrayed my kind.</text>
		<text id="dragon8">Then perhaps we can help you! All we ask for in return is knowledge.</text>
		<text id="dragon9">You think you can help? Then prove it. If you can hatch and bring me [var=quest.hatch_dragons.dragon] [item=dragon]s, then we will talk. Otherwise, begone!</text>
		<text id="dragon10">I knew you would betray me! Taste my wrath!</text>
		<text id="dragon11">I don't think we should wake her again until we have the [item=dragon]s.</text>
		<text id="dragon12">You have done it? Perhaps there is yet hope for my race.</text>
		<text id="dragon12_a">Excellent! So, you'll tell us the secrets of magic?</text>
		<text id="dragon13">Unfortunately, I do not know the secrets you seek. The old ones created us, and they built this lair to raise us.</text>
		<text id="dragon14">However, answers may lie on the islands to the east. Return to this lair when you are ready, and I will fly you there.</text>
		<text id="dragon15">Another dragon lair! Imagine how many dragons were once raised in lairs like these with magic! I wonder why... in any case, allow me to activate this lair.</text>
		<text id="dragon16">I also built a [color=770000]Wyrm Pen[/color] here, in case we need to raise more dragons! But don't expect me to harvest [item=dragonblood] here, I've got more important things to research.</text>
		<text id="call_dragon">Where did you leave the dragon? I'll call it over here - try not to lose track of it.</text>
		<text id="lair1">I knew it! This lair is artificial, made by magic! It looks like its purpose was to raise dragons!</text>
		<text id="lair2">I bet I can activate it...</text>
		<text id="lair3">Aha! Done! With this lair, we can raise our own dragons. The lair seems to point east, perhaps we could fly a dragon that direction and discover more...</text>
		<text id="axe1">Let me see that [item=rusty_axe]... It's tough to spot with all the rust, but I recognize those symbols!</text>
		<text id="axe2">There is some ancient magic here, but it is worn out. If you bring me the right magical ingredient, perhaps I can repair it...</text>
		<text id="axe3">That [item=fire_tusk]... what kind of creature did you get it from? It seems to resonate with the [item=rusty_axe], perhaps that is the magical ingredient we were looking for!</text>
		<text id="axe4">I have done it! I wonder who made this [item=thunder_axe], and how old it is? If you want to make more, I added the recipe to the laboratory.</text>
		<text id="shadow_cape1">Let me see that [item=dark_fur]! It appears to exist between the world of the spirits and the world of the living...</text>
		<text id="shadow_cape2">I'll have to research it further, but I can easily turn it into a [item=shadow_cape] that will hide you from normal eyes. I added the recipe to the laboratory.</text>
		<text id="magic_intro1">This island is overflowing with magic - we are definitely in the right place!</text>
		<text id="magic_intro2">I’ve seen this kind of magic before. These structures are partially organic and are all hibernating. They’ll need to be awoken.</text>
		<text id="magic_intro3">I already know how to activate this purple chamber, but the other structures will require more study.</text>
		<text id="magic_intro4">This should be a good base of operations. I'll set up some supplies.</text>
		<text id="wyrm1">Clues for activating the other structures might lie with the [item=wyrm]s.</text>
		<text id="wyrm2">You should follow one on this island and learn their secrets, while I translate some of these markings.</text>
		<text id="wyrm3">Don't worry - you've dealt with [item=wyrm]s before. Following one to its den should be no problem!</text>
		<text id="wyrm4">What's that? There was a Wyrm Queen? That's irrelevant, look at the [item=spirit_gem] you found! I'm certain this is what we need to make a breakthrough!</text>
		<text id="wyrm5">Here, try these [item=goggles]. The markings helped me invent them, and while they didn't help me see the secret behind these structures, they may help you see what we are missing.</text>
		<text id="wyrm6">You should follow the [item=wyrm]s on the eastern island, not here! I've already studied the [item=wyrm]s here!</text>
		<text id="sleep">I need more time to study this. Why don't you rest in the purple chamber?</text>
		<text id="forest">That forest to the east feels dangerous. I set up a [item=fence], and I recommend you don't go beyond it.</text>
		<text id="elementals1">I have determined that a [item=spirit_gem] can capture a spirit of fire or water, resulting in a [item=fire_gem] or [item=water_gem]. The infused gems should allow us to activate the structures.</text>
		<text id="elementals2">Having trouble finding elemental spirits? They are invisible to the naked eye, but my [item=goggles] should reveal them!</text>
		<text id="elementals3">You can place [item=spirit_gem]s like traps, then capture spirits by luring them onto them!</text>
		<text id="spirit_gem">Now all the structures are activated! I think we deserve a break in the purple chamber before we continue our research!</text>
		<text id="magic_farm1">What are you waiting for? Use the [item=water_gem] at the blue structure to activate it!</text>
		<text id="magic_farm2">The blue structure is a magical synthesizer! It can create items from magic!</text>
		<text id="magic_farm3">Use [item=focus_gem]s to power the synthesizer.</text>
		<text id="magic_farm4">We still need a [item=water_gem] to power the blue structure! Use a [item=spirit_gem] to capture a water elemental!</text>
		<text id="magic_forge1">What are you waiting for? Use the [item=fire_gem] at the red structure to activate it!</text>
		<text id="magic_forge2">The red structure is some sort of ancient magical forge. It can enchant items!</text>

		<text id="magic_forge4">We still need a [item=fire_gem] to power the red structure! Use a [item=spirit_gem] to capture a fire elemental!</text>
		<text id="alter_gem1">I’ve been in deep contemplation, trying to decode the secrets of the [item=wyrm]s.</text>
		<text id="alter_gem2">If you bring me [var=quest.alter_gem.wyrm] [item=wyrm], [var=quest.alter_gem.fire_tusk] [item=fire_tusk] and [var=quest.alter_gem.yeti_fur] [item=yeti_fur], I will be able to finish my research.</text>
		<text id="alter_gem3">I have done it! I have created an [item=alter_gem]! This will allow us to transform [item=wyrm]s - and probably other creatures - into usable equipment!</text>
		<text id="alter_gem4">We must continue to explore this branch of magic! Take this [item=alter_gem] and use it on a [item=wyrm] yourself! If you need more [item=alter_gem]s, I have added the recipe to the synthesizer.</text>
		<text id="alter_gem5">To use the [item=alter_gem], select it in your inventory, choose Transform, and choose a creature to transform.</text>
		<text id="alter_gem6">Don’t be afraid to try [item=alter_gem]s with other creatures… like a [item=dragon]. Or, dare I suggest it - an [item=adult_dragon]?!</text>
		<text id="alter_gem7">Running out of [item=alter_gem]s? You can find them deep underground or create them at the synthesizer.</text>
		<text id="alter_gem8">Make sure you use [item=alter_gem]s on well-fed creatures. Hungry creatures won't stay transformed long!</text>
		<text id="first1">You didn’t crash with the rest of us?</text>
		<text id="first2">No, I was part of a scouting mission for the colonization program.</text>
		<text id="first3">We were four. But, the other three died, and when they came soon after, I knew this planet was cursed.</text>
		<text id="first4">I barely survived, using what I'd learned of magic. Perhaps if I’d had those [item=goggles] back then, things would've been different.</text>
		<text id="first5">They were here?! After you?</text>
		<text id="first6">Yes. I believe they were jealous of my magic. Or frightened of it? It’s hard to say for sure...</text>
		<text id="second1">You met them on this planet ten years ago? That's before they tried to wipe out humanity and destroy Earth!</text>
		<text id="second2">Correct. I was the first to encounter them, and the first they tried to kill.</text>
		<text id="second3">I don't know what I could've done differently to stop the war. They arrived suddenly with their biological weapons and attacked without a word.</text>
		<text id="second4">If only there was a way to communicate with them...</text>
		<text id="second5">We probably could communicate with them now, using my magic translation.</text>
		<text id="second6">But, hopefully we'll never encounter them again, now that they seem content to ignore us.</text>
		<text id="oldone1">I’ve been noticing some very strange spikes in the magical energy lately. It could be nothing, but it could be one of them.</text>
		<text id="oldone2">If you find it, summon me immediately. If it really is one of them, we are all in grave danger.</text>
		<text id="oldone3">Alright, let’s see if my translation works!</text>

		<text id="oldone5">What right have you to ask me that? This is my home, my planet! You are the trespassers here!</text>
		<text id="oldone6">That magical exoskeleton looks vaguely familiar... are you one of them?</text>
		<text id="oldone7">The ones you call "them" are my foolish brethren. Long ago, they chose to abandon their homeworld, while I stayed and took a path of isolation and immortality.</text>
		<text id="oldone8">Can you tell us about your magic? What are these magical energy spikes? Why did you create and raise the dragons?</text>
		<text id="oldone9">Silence! We do not speak of these things with the likes of you! I have been very tolerant. Otherwise you would have been dead long ago.</text>
		<text id="oldone10">But now I see that they were right about one thing. The universe would be better off without you and your kind!</text>
		<text id="oldone11">You will regret choosing to disturb me!</text>
		<text id="oldone12">No!</text>
		<text id="oldone13">What’s wrong, didn’t we win?</text>
		<text id="oldone14">We were too slow! It sent out a signal. They will know we are on this planet!</text>
		<text id="oldone15">We must learn all the magic we can - and use their power against them when they come! Otherwise we are all doomed.</text>
		<text id="oldone16">You are more adept at magic than I expected! This cannot be allowed, only we should wield magic.</text>
		<text id="oldone17">It's sending a signal! If they hear it, they will come! I must finish this quickly!</text>
		<text id="oldone18">What happened? Are you ok?</text>
		<text id="oldone19">No…[pause=4] The signal was sent…[pause=4] And my life-force has been completely drained…</text>

		<text id="oldone_tips1">[tile=alchemist anim=alchemist.idle] I'll set up a defensive barrier and healing magic. Stay behind me while it attacks, and then hit it when it overloads.</text>

		<text id="bombardment">I hate to say it, but I think the only way we're getting out of this mess is by teaming up with the [object=mirrows]. They should be to the west where the main ship crashed.</text>
		<text id="bombardment2">While I don't agree with their methods, perhaps the [object=mirrows] were right. Now that they know we're here, we're going to need to fight to survive.</text>
		<text id="bombardment3">I can't believe the [object=mirrows] sacrificed themselves for us. That doesn't feel like them at all... Now who's going to continue the fight against them?</text>
		<text id="research1">You have a [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color]? I'll have you know that I was a highly respected researcher back on Earth. I think it's time to take out the old lab coat!</text>
		<text id="research2">It feels like forever since I last wore this coat. I think I'll miss being a hunter...</text>
		<text id="research3">But, [item=bow]s and [item=arrow]s will have no effect against them - if we are going to survive, we're going to need to work together to invent new weapons!</text>
		<text id="win1">Sounds like you had quite the fight! I wish I could’ve been there to help!</text>
		<text id="win2">It’s strange, even though I only became a hunter because we crash landed on their homeworld and I could go back to being a scientist now… I realized I prefer this life.</text>
		<text id="win3">I guess in a way, I have them to thank for helping me find myself.</text>
		<text id="win4">Excellent! I’ll take my bow and arrows and head over immediately!</text>
		<text id="werewolf">Don’t scare me like that!! If I still had my [item=bow], I might’ve shot an arrow before I realized it was you!</text>
		<text id="tent1">I shouldn't rest in some random person's tent!</text>
		<text id="tent2">This must be the [object=hunter]'s tent. I should leave it alone.</text>
		<text id="intro1">Hey, you! Did you see me take down that boar?</text>
		<text id="intro2">Yeah, how… how did you do that?</text>
		<text id="intro3">Simple! A bit of proper technique is all you need.</text>
		<text id="intro4">I’m trying to clear out this area. If you help me out I could teach you how to hunt.</text>
		<text id="accept1">You need to employ the element of surprise. Hit enemies from behind, and you’ll get a critical hit.</text>
		<text id="accept2">Here, have a [item=workbench] - you can use it in your inventory to make weapons of your own!</text>
		<text id="accept3">I prefer [item=bow]s so I don't have to get close to enemies, but if you want to use melee weapons, a [item=buckler] will help you block attacks!</text>
		<text id="accept4">Use [key=equipment] to equip a weapon, [key=attack] to attack with the equipped weapon, and [key=defend] to block with a shield.</text>
		<text id="accept5">Why don't you craft a [item=bow] and kill some [color=770000][tile=boar] Boars[/color]. And let me know if you need any hunting tips!</text>
		<text id="reject1">You seem dangerous. Stay out of our area!</text>
		<text id="reject2">Well, fine! I’ll just go back to the mountains then!</text>
		<text id="reject3">Ready to learn some hunting techniques?</text>
		<text id="hunt1">We’ll have this area cleared of dangerous creatures in no time!</text>
		<text id="hunt2">For a job well done, let me give you my old [item=backpack] - it might come in handy when you’re out in the field.</text>
		<text id="tip1">You could dig a tunnel to sneak up on boars and hit them from behind.</text>
		<text id="tip2">[item=red_berries] can be used to temporarily increase your attack power - but be careful, they’re not good for your health.</text>
		<text id="tip3">If you keep getting “blocked,” that enemy is too strong for you. You’ll need a better weapon or a stronger attack.</text>
		<text id="tip4">Setting [item=arrow]s to a hotkey lets you fire them as long as the [item=bow] is in your inventory, even if it's not equipped!</text>
		<text id="tent3">So there I was, shivering and alone on the dark mountainside, when I saw firelight! And heard laughter! It sounded so companionable...</text>
		<text id="tent4">So you came down to make friends with us?</text>
		<text id="tent5">Of course not. And I certainly wasn’t hunting boars to try and impress you. Not at all.</text>
		<text id="tent6">I simply wanted to expand my hunting range.</text>
		<text id="tent7">I’d like to know more about this place, and whether there’s anything beyond this island…</text>
		<text id="tent8">There’s other islands out there to the east. I’ve seen them, from high in the mountains.</text>
		<text id="tent9">Think we could get there?</text>
		<text id="tent10">Not sure. The coast on that end is treacherous. Plus, those islands looked plenty strange to me. Might be dangerous.</text>
		<text id="tent11">So you’re saying we should just be content with the way things are?</text>
		<text id="tent12">I’m saying that we don’t need to go borrowing trouble when life is already hard.</text>
		<text id="fence1">I’d like to keep the wildlife in check around here.</text>
		<text id="fence2">Could you use the [item=workbench] I gave you to make [var=quest.fence.fence] [item=fence]s? Then we could start setting up a perimeter.</text>
		<text id="fence3">Perfect. [color=770000][tile=boar] Boar[/color]s can't run through [item=fence]s, so we can use them to protect our settlement.</text>
		<text id="fence4">I'll place one here, place the other [item=fence]s around our base to protect it!</text>
		<text id="wolf1">I've noticed a wolf pup hanging around our settlement. He seems lonely.</text>
		<text id="wolf2">Doesn't he have a pack?</text>
		<text id="wolf3">They must have left him behind.</text>
		<text id="wolf4">With [var=quest.wolf.net] [item=net]s, [var=quest.wolf.trap] [item=trap]s and [var=quest.wolf.meat] [item=meat], we may be able to tame him.</text>
		<text id="wolf5">Okay, let’s see what we can do with this pup.</text>
		<text id="wolf6">Well done, he seems to trust you completely. You have a loyal companion now.</text>

		<text id="tip1">Use [item=sulfur] and a [item=steel_bar] to make a [item=battery] at the [color=770000]Power Plant[/color]. You can recharge them there, too.</text>
		<text id="tip2">Simply add a [item=battery] to your inventory to power your equipment.</text>
		<text id="tip3">Your total [tile=power] [color=444400]Power[/color] will be displayed below your [tile=health] [color=770000]Health[/color] and [tile=stamina] [color=006600]Stamina[/color] .</text>
		<text id="factory1">Now that we finally have power again, I wish we had some new machinery to play with.</text>
		<text id="factory2">If you help me get a [color=770000]Factory[/color] set up, we could manufacture all sorts of things!</text>
		<text id="factory3">This will be awesome. Finally a new project to tinker with!</text>
		<text id="factory4">Now we can refine materials and build [item=drill]s, [item=chainsaw]s, [item=shotgun]s, and other cool stuff.</text>
		<text id="elevator1">I noticed you’ve been doing a lot of mining.</text>
		<text id="elevator2">Wouldn’t it be convenient to have a contraption to help you haul everything back to the surface?!</text>
		<text id="elevator3">Nice! Let's do this!</text>
		<text id="elevator4">Going up? Or should I say down!</text>
		<text id="repair">Need anything repaired? I’m your gal!</text>
		<text id="dragon">What is that fire-breathing creature powering the plant? It better not break it!</text>
		<text id="intro1">There are more survivors here than I expected!</text>
		<text id="intro2">Yeah? But it's not enough. If we're to survive as a species we'll need to join up with other colonies.</text>
		<text id="intro3">You think they made it?</text>
		<text id="intro4">I'm sure they're out there. We just need a way to find and reach them.</text>
		<text id="intro5">And if we're attacked on the way?</text>
		<text id="intro6">Then at least we tried! I'm not going to sit here clammed up on this planet just because it feels safe for the moment.</text>
		<text id="mirrows1">Hey, what’s wrong? You look down.</text>
		<text id="mirrows2">I tried asking the Mirrows to stop harassing everyone, but they won’t listen and I don't want to fight them.</text>
		<text id="mirrows3">Good of you to try. But they’re stubborn as mules, and don't listen to anything except strength.</text>
		<text id="mirrows4">I’m not giving up yet. It’s not fair that they can abuse their power like this.</text>
		<text id="mirrows5">Maybe try to learn as much as you can about the Mirrows. Have you checked out all the areas around their lab?</text>
		<text id="mirrows6">Are you the “C” in the Mirrows’ lab notes? Were you working with them?</text>
		<text id="mirrows7">No… not exactly. They’re - [pause=4]They’re my parents.</text>
		<text id="mirrows8">Your parents!? If you’re their daughter, maybe they’d listen to you. Will you try negotiating with them?</text>
		<text id="mirrows9">Believe me, I’ve tried. They won’t listen to reason. They’re too focused on their “enhancements” and won’t even consider other solutions to our problems.</text>
		<text id="mirrows10">We’d need something really powerful to get them to change directions. Something that can't be explained with science.</text>
		<text id="mirrows11">What do you think about this [item=dragon_armor]? It has the power of an [item=adult_dragon], but can be worn like armor!</text>
		<text id="mirrows12">That's so weird, but I definitely think it's worth a shot. Let's show it to my parents.</text>
		<text id="mirrows13">Back again? This time we'll turn you into a cyborg for sure!</text>
		<text id="mirrows14">Wait! Don't attack, it's me.</text>
		<text id="mirrows15">Cass? What are you doing here?</text>
		<text id="mirrows16">I want you to take a look at this. Maybe you don’t have to turn people into cyborgs after all.</text>
		<text id="mirrows17">What is this thing? Its power readings are off the charts, but it doesn’t appear man made at all!</text>
		<text id="mirrows18">If I tell you, will you agree to stop your human experimentation and extortion?</text>
		<text id="mirrows19">Of course, this could be a whole new line of research for us!</text>
		<text id="mirrows20">It turns out the species who originally inhabited this planet created the dragons and magical equipment. And, that species may have been - them.</text>
		<text id="mirrows21">We'll be using their own creations against them! What delicious irony!</text>
		<text id="sleep">Don't you know what time it is? I'm sure whatever you need can wait until morning...</text>

		<text id="bombardment2">The [object=mirrows] say that they have returned, and that the surface is not safe anymore.</text>

		<text id="bombardment4">The bombardment is over? Excellent! Now I just need everyone to return to the surface and I'll be back in business!</text>
		<text id="win1">Welcome to the Golden Key! Finest inn and historic site on the planet where humanity’s resurgence began!</text>
		<text id="win2">Ah, it’s the star who brought about our final victory! It would be my honor to let you stay here, at no charge of course!</text>
		<text id="win3">Just keep the other guests entertained with war stories, and make sure to tell them of my generosity!</text>
		<text id="intro1">Welcome to the Golden Key! Finest (and only) room and board this side of the desert!</text>
		<text id="intro2">So this is an inn? Do you get many people through here?</text>
		<text id="intro3">A fair few come through Sunset Haven - exploring, trading, looking for a place to call home.</text>
		<text id="intro4">But if we don't get power back soon who knows if anyone will stay. I can't tell you how many times I've been tempted to go and give those Mirrows a piece of my mind!</text>
		<text id="power1">Wonderful! The power is back!</text>
		<text id="power2">No thanks to those darn Mirrows. I can’t believe we all still pay them dues to keep the technology running around here!</text>
		<text id="power3">And not only do they fry the power plant, they can’t be bothered to come around and fix it?!</text>
		<text id="power4">Can’t you just stop paying them?</text>
		<text id="power5">I can’t leave the inn, but if someone would go to the desert and confront them about it, maybe we could back out of this unfair arrangement.</text>
		<text id="no_power">I'm afraid we can't let you stay here until the power comes back on.</text>

		<text id="no_money">Not enough money? Then I'm afraid you can't stay here. This isn't a charity you know!</text>
		<text id="scene1">I hear the main ship crashed around here somewhere? How did you survive without life pods?</text>
		<text id="scene2">That's exactly our problem. The Mirrows saved us. They did some unbelievable last minute enhancements and protected an entire sector from obliteration. So we're in their debt.</text>
		<text id="scene3">But now, they destroyed our power, and they’re letting strange creatures loose to wreak havoc.</text>
		<text id="scene4">I've even heard that some folk have gone missing in the desert, where the Mirrows were last seen.</text>
		<text id="scene5">And they expect us to put up with all this? And even pay dues to them? It’s become too much.</text>
		<text id="mirrows1">The Mirrows agreed to stop asking you for money and experimenting on people!</text>
		<text id="mirrows2">Excellent! Maybe we can finally have some peace around here now.</text>

		<text id="bombardment2">I can't believe you defeated an enemy bomber! I'm sure they will send another wave, but I almost believe we have a chance now!</text>
		<text id="bombardment3">The [object=mirrows] are dead!? To be honest, I never thought highly of them, but after their sacrifice I can't help but believe they were only acting in our best interests.</text>
		<text id="win1">The war is over?! Then it’s back to the open skies and seas for me! I’ll see you topside!</text>
		<text id="win2">The war is won, the threat is over, and we have a whole planet to rebuild on! Exciting times are ahead, and I bet we’ll need good sailors in this world. Maybe I should get a spaceship license...</text>
		<text id="win3">The clear skies, the smell of salt water… the fresh air… this is how life should be. And never again will we have to worry about an alien bomber darkening the skies!</text>
		<text id="win4">I was wondering where everyone had gone! It was starting to feel pretty empty here. I’ll head over there now!</text>
		<text id="win5">Just one thing before I go - can you take care of my [item=cat], Peri? She won’t come to me, and I’d feel a lot better if someone looked after her when I’m gone.</text>
		<text id="intro1">Finally back on land again! You look like you just arrived too!</text>
		<text id="intro1_alt">Hey there! It's nice to see other survivors sailing out here!</text>
		<text id="intro2">Don't mind her, that's just Polly’s way of saying hello. Hope you don’t mind a bit of seawater on your boots!</text>
		<text id="intro3">So, have you been to this island before?</text>
		<text id="intro3_alt">So, do you know what island lies ahead?</text>
		<text id="intro4">Sure have, this island's called Sunset Haven, and it has more survivors than any other island I've seen.</text>
		<text id="intro4_alt">Sure do, the island's called Sunset Haven, and it has more survivors than any other island I've seen.</text>
		<text id="intro5">Makes sense too - as it is where the main ship crashed.</text>
		<text id="intro6">But watch yourself. I've heard some bad rumors about Sunset Haven lately...</text>
		<text id="cat1">Hey, my [item=cat] Peri ran away from me again! Do you think you could help me find her?</text>
		<text id="cat2">I think she’s trying to avoid sailing. Not a fan of the water.</text>
		<text id="cat3">If you help me out, I'll teach you what I know of fishing.</text>
		<text id="cat4">Awesome, thanks! Here's a spare [item=fishing_rod], talk to me if you want fishing tips!</text>
		<text id="cat5">[item=toothfish] are Peri's favorite food, maybe you can tempt her with some of those?</text>
		<text id="cat6">Hey, you found my [item=cat]! Thanks, man.</text>
		<text id="cat7">Sheesh, looks like you completely won her over. I bet she’d be happier with you. Why don’t you keep her?</text>
		<text id="cat8">The cat is too fast for you to grab!</text>
		<text id="cat9">She snatched the [item=toothfish] from my hand, but she’s too fast, I can’t catch her.</text>
		<text id="cat11">Give Peri a [item=toothfish]?</text>
		<text id="cat12">She didn’t bolt away as fast this time.</text>
		<text id="cat13">Come here Peri... that's a good girl...</text>
		<text id="cat15">One cat successfully captured!</text>
		<text id="tip1">Fishing is all about timing. Use your fishing rod at the end of the dock and then hit [key=select] when there is something on the line - too soon or too late, and you'll lose the catch!</text>
		<text id="tip2">If it says "Wait for it...", the fish needs a little more coaxing. Wait until it says "Pull now!" then hit [key=select] again!</text>
		<text id="tip3">Some fish are more difficult to catch and require more keys. Keep an eye on the tooltip, and hit the key it shows!</text>

	<section id="mirrows">
		<text id="water_cave1">Many essential ship components landed in the ocean when we crashed. If we could salvage them, we could perhaps find a way off this planet.</text>
		<text id="water_cave2">But how can we retrieve them from underwater? Could we build a submarine?</text>
		<text id="water_cave3">Certainly, if we had a good launch point. I think there's an underground cave on the western side of this island that has access to the ocean.</text>
		<text id="water_cave4">If you find this cave and bring us some materials, we could build a [color=770000]Sub Pen[/color]!</text>
		<text id="water_cave5">You've found the cave and gathered the materials? Excellent, let's head there right away!</text>
		<text id="water_cave6">You can build and upgrade a [object=sub] at the [color=770000]Sub Pen[/color]! You can also recharge the [object=sub]'s battery power here.</text>
		<text id="water_cave7">Based on the water currents, the [item=ship_parts] should have traveled west. If you can find some, it will open the doors to many powerful inventions!</text>
		<text id="water_cave8">We also made this [item=com_device] so you can contact us anywhere on the planet. Get in touch as soon as you find something!</text>
		<text id="airport1">They're a little rusted, but we already designed some [item=airport_blueprint]s that will make good use of these [item=ship_parts]!</text>
		<text id="airport2">The [color=770000]Airport[/color] will allow you to build [object=jet]s. While they can't reach outer space, they can fly pretty high and will make getting around a lot easier!</text>
		<text id="spaceship1">If we want to repair the spaceship, we'll need a lot more [item=ship_parts]... and some [item=power_core]s too. See what you can find with the [object=sub].</text>
		<text id="build_sub1">Ah, you built the [object=sub]! When riding the [object=sub], hit [key=equipment] to repair, recharge and customize it!</text>
		<text id="build_sub2">You might want to install a weapon system like the [item=torpedo_launcher] too, otherwise you'll be defenseless! Hit [key=attack] to fire the installed weapon.</text>
		<text id="sub_empty1">I got a signal that the [object=sub] is out of juice! Hopefully you have some [item=battery default=Batteries].</text>
		<text id="sub_empty2">You can restore the [object=sub]'s power by hitting [key=equipment] and then selecting [tile=battery.ico] Charge from Batteries.</text>
		<text id="sub1">You sound like you're lost. Try returning to the Water Cave, we can guide you to the [item=ship_parts] from there.</text>
		<text id="sub2">Based on the water currents, the [item=ship_parts] should have traveled west. Keep heading west and see if you can find anything.</text>
		<text id="sub3">You found another island? Then the [item=ship_parts] may have washed ashore there... or perhaps they entered a cave. Check around for any underwater cave entrances.</text>
		<text id="sub4">You found an underwater cave? That sounds very promising, I bet the [item=ship_parts] ended up there!</text>
		<text id="sub5">Be careful though, underwater caves like that can be dangerous and unpredictable. Keep an eye out for caverns where you can restore your [tile=oxygen] [color=ffffff]Oxygen[/color].</text>
		<text id="mirrow_same_room">You realize we're right here... right?</text>
		<text id="mirrow_power_core">You found [item=power_core_parts]? Keep track of those, we may be able to build a [item=power_core] which will let us power the spaceship.</text>
		<text id="ship_parts1">You found the [item=ship_parts]? Excellent! Return to the Sunset Haven cave, we've already come up with something to make use of the [item=ship_parts]!</text>
		<text id="ship_parts2">Or you could explore a bit more, perhaps there is more to find out west.</text>
		<text id="ship_parts3">We're improving the lab to better utilize the [item=ship_parts] you found. Make yourself useful and keep searching for other debris out west.</text>
		<text id="escort_ship1">You found the wreckage of an escort ship? That would be a lot smaller and easier to repair than the [color=770000]Colony Ship[/color]!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship2">Bring us some [item=ship_parts], and then we'll take a look at the wreckage!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship3">We're on our way to survey the damage, meet us there. This could be a major breakthrough!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship4">Well, what are we waiting for? We must head there immediately! Prep the [object=jet]!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship5">It looks bad, but we can work with this. It'll need a lot of [item=ship_parts] to repair though!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship6">Excellent! Give us a call when you have everything!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship7">I said to give us a call once you had EVERYTHING! If you forgot what we need to repair the ship, check your quest log with [key=quest].</text>
		<text id="escort_ship8">The relocation of the lab is pretty much finished. Now we just need those parts to repair the ship, and we'll really be going places!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship9">The spaceship will need a [item=power_core] to fly, but try entering it and checking out all the systems - especially the control room!</text>
		<text id="escort_power_core1">You could create a [item=power_core] from [item=power_core_parts] in an [color=770000]Advanced Laboratory[/color], but that section of the [color=770000]Colony Ship[/color] broke off.</text>
		<text id="escort_power_core2">Perhaps enough of it is intact somewhere for the [object=mechanic] to repair it?</text>
		<text id="escort_ship10">You got everything? Perfect, let's see if this ship can still be repaired! Meet us at the crash site!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship11">Well look at that! It looks as good as new, and ready to launch into space!</text>
		<text id="escort_ship12">It's quite the accomplishment! It won't be able to defeat them without weapons, but it sure gives us options!</text>
		<text id="ride_back">We're heading back to the water cave, do you want a ride?</text>
		<text id="ride_water_cave">Do you want us to pick you up and fly you to the water cave?</text>
		<text id="jet_door">The door leads to a launch pad for the [object=mirrows] private [object=jet].</text>
		<text id="jet_door2">No, I shouldn't steal their [object=jet], as tempting as that sounds.</text>
		<text id="jet_door3">Now that the [object=mirrows] are gone, I guess this [object=jet] belongs to Cass...</text>
		<text id="jet_door4">There's no one left who can claim this [object=jet]... it was a long and hard journey, but the time has finally come to steal it!</text>
		<text id="boring_machine">Why are you building boring machines? We have much more important things to do right now!</text>
		<text id="ship_bed">Ah, do you want to try our amazing rejuvenation pod? If you pay 50 [color=770000][tile=coin_purse.ico] Coins[/color] for the energy cost, we'll let you.</text>
		<text id="no_money">But you don't have 50 [color=770000][tile=coin_purse.ico] Coins[/color]... Maybe try selling some junk at the [color=770000]Market[/color], that's what we do when we're strapped for cash!</text>
		<text id="blueprints1">We need more funds for our research, so we decided to start selling inventions and [tile=blueprint.ico] [color=770000]Blueprint[/color]s!</text>
		<text id="blueprints2">All sales go towards a good cause. Make sure to come back, as anytime we invent something new we'll add it to the store!</text>
		<text id="blueprints3">Feel free to stop by the {area} and check out what we have!</text>
		<text id="bombardment1">They came too soon! We knew this was coming and tried to prepare, but we just didn't have enough time!</text>
		<text id="bombardment2">I'm certain this is only their first wave - we'll need to act fast to destroy their bomber before the second wave arrives!</text>
		<text id="bombardment3">To destroy the bomber, we'll first need a spaceship, and we'll also need some powerful weapons. It won't be easy, but perhaps with your help we can do something!</text>
		<text id="bombardment4">We have strengthened the hull and this cargo hold has enough fresh food and water to hold out for years... but if we can't do something about that bombardment, it will all be for nothing.</text>
		<text id="bombardment5">You have defeated the enemy bomber!? Then we have time until the next wave arrives, but we must act fast!</text>
		<text id="bombardment6">We have finally completed our secret weapon! It is a spaceship we cobbled together using spare [item=ship_parts] with an experimental weapon that should be able to take down their shields!</text>
		<text id="bombardment7">We haven't had time to test it, but we must end the bombardment soon or their reinforcements will arrive! Unless you have a better plan, we will launch now!</text>
		<text id="bombardment8">Very well - but act fast! If you change your mind, simply talk to us again!</text>
		<text id="sacrifice1">This clunker actually made it into space! The enemy bomber is in our sights, now to test out this new weapon!</text>
		<text id="sacrifice2">We'll only have one chance at this - I'll take down the enemy shields, and then hit it with everything we have!</text>
		<text id="sacrifice3">If we miss...[pause=1] or don't make it back...[pause=1] it'll be up to you to protect everyone.[pause=1] And tell Cass...[pause=1] Nevermind...</text>
		<text id="sacrifice4">I know we didn't always see eye to eye, but I hope this attack shows you that the only way to survive is power!</text>
		<text id="sacrifice5">That's enough chatting - we better attack it before it notices us! Mirrows, signing out!</text>
		<text id="sacrifice6">Mirrows! Come in! Can you read me! What happened up there!?</text>
		<text id="sacrifice7">The signal is lost. They didn't make it...</text>
		<text id="send_mirrows">Use Mirrow's Plan</text>
		<text id="have_plan">Defeat Bomber Yourself</text>
		<text id="research1">Incredible! This is the perfect place to advance our research! I will have to thank this [object=professor] for designing this superb mobile laboratory.</text>
		<text id="research2">The only thing it is missing is a [color=770000]Surgery Lab[/color]! But, there is room in here to build one (or even two)! I trust you'll make good use of the [item=operation_table_blueprint].</text>
		<text id="research3">It even has a [color=770000]Surgery Lab[/color]! Everything we could want in one, compact, mobile package!</text>
		<text id="on_bomber">... you should probably leave the enemy bomber before we try to destroy it! Let us know when you're safely away from it, and then call us again!</text>
		<text id="research_lab">You built a [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color]?! Well, what are you waiting for, bring it closer so we can board it!</text>
		<text id="cyborg1">The colonists seem to think [item=exotic_matter] is the solution to everything... but don't underestimate the power of cybernetic enhancements!</text>
		<text id="cyborg2">We've discovered a new kind of [item=carapace] on the colony world's surface, and with it and some research funds, we should be able to invent powerful cyborg upgrades!</text>
		<text id="cyborg3">Excellent! We knew we could count on you! This [item=carapace] is perfect for binding man and machine without any rejection or loss!</text>
		<text id="cyborg4">The research is finished, and you can find the new equipment in the [color=770000]Surgery Lab[/color]!</text>
		<text id="com_device">Did Cass give you that [item=com_device]? We have one too, let me add us to your contacts in case you want to talk to us!</text>
		<text id="win1">The war is won?! I hope our cyborg enhancements were useful in the final battle!</text>
		<text id="win2">What should we do now? We can’t possibly give up on our cyborg research just because the war is over!</text>
		<text id="win3">Very true. We’ll just have to prepare for the next war! Whether it’s with humans or aliens, you can be sure there will always be another!</text>
		<text id="werewolf1">Fascinating - this [object=unnature.splicer] must be a master of manipulating genomes! You don’t even appear to be human anymore!</text>
		<text id="werewolf2">If you were expecting help from us, you’ll be disappointed. We are not veterinarians, our expertise is with human cyborgification!</text>
		<text id="intro1">Are you two the Mirrows? Why have you been tormenting Sunset Haven and creating those strange mutants?</text>
		<text id="intro2">You don't understand! We're doing this for the good of everyone! We cannot survive without ultimate weapons!</text>
		<text id="intro3">When they come to exterminate the last of us, we'll be ready! The sacrifices made have been necessary.</text>
		<text id="intro4">You can't just go around sacrificing people for a future that may never come to be! There are better ways to save everyone!</text>
		<text id="intro5">If you’re determined to work against us, we have no choice but to fight you.</text>
		<text id="intro6">I have a feeling your body is just what I need for my new Cyborg invention!</text>
		<text id="defeat0">Unbelievable! Somehow you are stronger than I am, even with our advanced cybernetics!</text>
		<text id="defeat1">You must tell us the secrets of your strength - you could be the key to saving humanity!</text>
		<text id="defeat2">If I tell you my secrets will you agree to stop harassing the townsfolk and asking them for money?</text>
		<text id="defeat3">Of course. Why would we need those dull specimens when we have you!?</text>
		<text id="defeat4">This will be a whole new line of research for us!</text>
		<text id="defeat5">Feel free to use our surgery lab. We’d be very interested to see how powerful you become with our cybernetic enhancements!</text>
		<text id="tip1">You can remove cybernetic enhancements at any time by selecting it in your equipment window and choosing remove. You can re-install enhancements later at the surgery lab, but it will cost more resources.</text>
		<text id="nav1">Looks like the navigation screen is still working. According to this, we are currently on Unoiks 428c.</text>
		<text id="nav2">Did the Mirrows add this note?! I have to ask them about this...</text>
		<text id="nav3">We're on the Enemy Homeworld? How do you know?</text>
		<text id="nav4">We can't be certain... but we took samples of many ruins on this planet. Not only are they a match for their technology, but they date back over a million years ago!</text>

		<text id="second1">… so when I arrived here I just started digging and didn’t even realize there was a storm.</text>
		<text id="second2">But I’m glad you’re here. I was getting tired of eating dirt, and there’s nothing like a warm fire after a long day underground.</text>
		<text id="second3">Do you think there are more survivors out there?</text>
		<text id="second4">Honestly, I’m surprised anyone survived that crash. But here we are, so maybe others survived too?</text>
		<text id="third1">Now I bet you youngin’s are thinking this here’s the end of the world, but I thought the same during World War 3 and yet here we all are.</text>
		<text id="third2">The way I sees it, we just got to make the best of the situation, and be glad there’s food to eat and company to share.</text>
		<text id="third3">But how long will we have to live on this god-forsaken island?</text>
		<text id="third4">Who knows? But as long as there’s life, there’s hope. Perhaps in time this island will be as good as home.</text>
		<text id="fourth1">So tell us what you know of other survivors?</text>
		<text id="fourth2">Most of us were scattered across different islands, but some of the islands have more survivors and even some working technology.</text>
		<text id="fourth3">I’ve even heard rumors of an island with a nearly intact ship.</text>
		<text id="fourth4">Could it still fly?</text>
		<text id="fourth5">As I said, all I’ve heard are rumors. But even if it could, it’d be certain death. Best to stay on this planet, they don’t seem to care about us here.</text>
		<text id="hunter1">You're so good at this stuff. Were you a hunter before the crash?</text>
		<text id="hunter2">Heh. Never killed an animal in my life before this. I was a scientist. Lab work. Molecules.</text>
		<text id="hunter3">Wow. How'd you figure it all out then?</text>
		<text id="hunter4">It's amazing what you can do when you need to survive.</text>
		<text id="hunter5">You change. You become someone your old self would barely recognize.</text>
		<text id="mirrows1">They’ve been rebuilding technology?</text>
		<text id="mirrows2">Yeah, Sunset Haven has power and industrial equipment.</text>
		<text id="mirrows3">But the folks there aren’t too happy with the Mirrows who set it all up.</text>
		<text id="mirrows4">The Mirrows survived!?</text>
		<text id="mirrows5">You know them?</text>
		<text id="mirrows6">Unfortunately. We were part of the same research group back home, studying genetics.</text>
		<text id="mirrows7">After the attack, they started doing awful stuff like human experimentation. I could no longer work with them.</text>
		<text id="mirrows8">Hey, we should rebuild some technology here, too! If they can do it, why not us?</text>
		<text id="mirrows9">That's the spirit! This place will feel just like home in no time.</text>

		<text id="lifepod4">This life-pod... it has the same number as the one I launched in! This is where it must have ended up after sinking!</text>
		<text id="lifepod5">USER LOG: The world has ended, we're stranded on an alien planet, there's no real hope for humanity... and yet I cling to life so fervently. Who would've thought that I would learn to treasure life now that it's too late?</text>
		<text id="lifepod6">USER LOG: I wonder if we'll find sentient life on this planet? I mean, life other than THEM. There must be other sentient life forms out there. I hope some are friendly.</text>
		<text id="lifepod7">USER LOG: I doubt anyone will see this log, but if you do, know that I was a soldier aboard the escort ship. It barely survived the jump and crashed into the tallest peak on this planet.</text>
		<text id="panel1">3/15 - We have been left with no choice but to abandon Earth. Our weapons cannot hurt them, and they pursue us with a vengeance. Perhaps, on another planet, we can finally evade their wrath.</text>
		<text id="panel13">5/1 - The ship was heavily damaged in the escape, but the jump drive activated successfully. That should keep us ahead of pursuers, assuming the ship survives the journey.</text>
		<text id="panel2">6/30 - Fleshed out new plan for human augmentation and survivability, including number and type of specimens necessary to achieve our goals. Mr. H has left the research group.</text>
		<text id="panel3">8/5 - Reached target planet but cannot enter atmosphere safely and there are not enough life pods. Probability of survival low, even for augmented subjects. No sign of the enemy.</text>
		<text id="panel4">9/2 - Hull reinforcement progressing, but survival requires augmentation. Dissidents are protesting the procedure, even though their lives depend on it.</text>
		<text id="panel5">9/26 - Can no longer maintain orbit. Many have accepted augmentation, and some who wouldn't were launched in the life pods. Hopefully the reinforcement will be enough for the rest.</text>
		<text id="panel6">10/4 - Emergency reinforcement was largely successful, but estimated number of survivors is far lower than hoped, even considering life pods we cannot account for.</text>
		<text id="panel7">10/5 - Species viability is now a major concern. With only a few hundred individuals, we cannot survive without drastic intervention. Beginning new line of research.</text>
		<text id="panel8">11/20 - Established basic infrastructure east of crash site. Gathering new specimens for experimentation.</text>
		<text id="panel14">12/14 - Species viability research has stalled, but combat research looks promising. Cybernetic enhancements are able to turn an average civilian into a war machine.</text>
		<text id="panel9">12/24 - C disapproves of combat research. Instead of preparing for their return and enhance species viability, C wants to return to the stars and search for other survivors.</text>
		<text id="panel10">1/6 - C left the lab and made it clear we were no longer welcome in town. Moving base of operations into old lab in the remains of sector 22.</text>
		<text id="panel15">1/31 - Applying Cybernetic research to ourselves due to lack of test subjects. Still no sign of the enemy, but perhaps this time we will be able to fight them.</text>
		<text id="panel11">2/9 - Coerced townsfolk to help fund research. Also obtained new test subjects (vagabonds and outcasts). Research is progressing again.</text>
		<text id="panel12">2/27 - Ran out of vagabonds, so had to gather test subjects from the townsfolk. If viability research is not completed soon, we will run out of test subjects again.</text>

		<text id="mechanic2">I don't know how they built it, but that's an [color=770000]Advanced Laboratory[/color]! I should be able to design a blueprint for it using the scanned schematics...</text>
		<text id="mechanic3">Perfect! I'm already drooling over all the new equipment we should be able to build with this!</text>
		<text id="complete1">Awesome job - the seas are finally safe again! I think this deserves a reward, and I know just what, follow me to the inn!</text>
		<text id="complete2">Hey Mortimer, the waters are safe from pirates thanks to my friend here! I think you should give them a medal of honor and let them stay at the inn for free!</text>
		<text id="complete3">Stay here for free? Preposterous! Food and housing isn't cheap on this god-forsaken planet!</text>
		<text id="complete4">I think you owe it to all of us traders and fishermen! If we had all been killed by pirates, there would be no food, period!</text>
		<text id="complete5">Fine. They can stay here for free. But I'm not giving them any medals!</text>
		<text id="stay_free">Fine... You can stay here for free. Just don't tell anyone, or everyone will be begging for free meals!</text>

		<text id="intro1">이런, 당신을 보지 못할뻔 했어… 당신은 너무 작군...</text>
		<text id="intro2">I can understand you?</text>
		<text id="intro3">I cast a translation spell when I realized you weren’t one of them. It’s one of the tricks I picked up in my old age.</text>
		<text id="intro4">Speaking of them, I need help! The Old One sent out a signal, and they are coming! It’s all my fault, I need to find a way to stop them!</text>
		<text id="intro5">What was that? They are coming back?! After betraying my kind and abandoning me here as worthless?</text>
		<text id="intro6">Ouch! My back! I should not have done that… but thinking of them just fills me with rage!</text>
		<text id="intro7">So will you help me?</text>
		<text id="intro8">If I can. But I’m not as young as I once was. I can’t even remember the last time I left this island.</text>
		<text id="cultivator1">On the main island to the east, there is the [color=770000]Cultivator[/color]. Without their magic, it has gone mad and is wreaking havoc.</text>
		<text id="cultivator2">If you defeat it, you will be able to activate a [color=770000]Vine Copse[/color], one of their ancient magic chambers. It could prove useful to you.</text>
		<text id="cultivator3">I recommend using fire against it. I would help you myself, were it not so hard to fly... and breathe fire.</text>
		<text id="cultivator4">This is magnificent. Now that the [color=770000]Vine Copse[/color] has been revived, transformation magic - the type of magic that sustains dragon-kind - will spread through the land once again.</text>
		<text id="cultivator5">Take these [item=horn]s - they can be used to increase the damage of any familiar at the [color=770000]Vine Copse[/color]!</text>
		<text id="cultivator6">The [color=770000]Vine Copse[/color] lives again! With it, you can enchant familiars, create traps to capture magical creatures, and grow seeds.</text>
		<text id="betrayal1">How did they betray you?</text>
		<text id="betrayal2">A long time ago, back when there were only [item=wyrm]s, they claimed they wanted to help us. They unlocked our potential, evolving us into dragons.</text>
		<text id="betrayal3">But eventually they changed. They stopped helping us grow and started using us to achieve their own goals, forcing us into servitude.</text>
		<text id="betrayal4">And then they abandoned us when we outlived our usefulness, taking their magic secrets with them. No longer can we evolve, and the last of the dragons are dying out.</text>
		<text id="betrayal5">I’ve spent the past millenia cursing their names and trying to learn magic to help the [item=wyrm]s myself.</text>
		<text id="betrayal6">If all I can do at this age is help you exterminate them, I will do so willingly!</text>
		<text id="betrayal7">I never said anything about exterminating them, only surviving!</text>
		<text id="betrayal8">Oh.[pause=1] Well, keep it in mind if the opportunity arises!</text>
		<text id="fish_village1">Normally, I eat fish without listening to their screams. But sometimes I use my translation magic for fun, and I heard something that may be useful.</text>
		<text id="fish_village2">Apparently, there's a colony of fish studying magic off the east coast of the [color=770000]Cultivator[/color]'s island. I wouldn't take fish too seriously, but perhaps they could help.</text>
		<text id="ship1">You have made an [item=evo_gem]? That is how they made us into [object=fly_ancient_dragon]s! Simply use the evolution gem on an [item=adult_dragon]!</text>
		<text id="ship2">Once you have raised an [object=fly_ancient_dragon], the next step is to evolve it into a [color=770000]Dragon Ship[/color] at the top of the large floating island to the east called [color=770000]Dragon Island[/color].</text>
		<text id="ship2.1">Unfortunately, [color=770000]Dragon Island[/color] is guarded by a dangerous ice monster. Only powerful [color=770000][tile=fire.ico] Fire[/color] magic will harm it.</text>
		<text id="ship3">While they created [color=770000]Dragon Ships[/color] millenia ago and are sure to have something more powerful now, this could be the first step towards defeating them!</text>
		<text id="ship4">Once they learned our potential for becoming organic spaceships, they no longer treated us as sentient beings, but instead as machines for turning into their fleet.</text>
		<text id="ship5">They began to seek ultimate power, and no longer cared about trying to help us like they once had.</text>
		<text id="ship6">I gave you the secret of [color=770000]Dragon Ships[/color] willingly so that we could fight them… please don’t abuse us the same way they did.</text>
		<text id="ship7">You have done it? Then I have given you all the help I can - I know no more of their ships or magic.</text>
		<text id="ship8">I would join you in the fight, but I was never able to turn into a [color=770000]Dragon Ship[/color]. Besides, it is the job of the elderly to send the young off on perilous quests rife with danger, no?</text>
		<text id="ship9">The Exiled thinks that you can help me. I’m trying to discover their magical secrets.</text>
		<text id="ship10">You would listen to one of them and discover their secrets!? Well, I do owe you a debt, so I will tell you what I know.</text>
		<text id="ship11">They used to use [item=evo_gem]s to evolve us into [color=770000]Dragon Ships[/color] at the top of the large floating island to the east called [color=770000]Dragon Island[/color].</text>
		<text id="ship12">Perhaps this secret will help you - I can only hope that you will not abuse us the same way they did.</text>
		<text id="win1">You have defeated them?! Vengeance is fulfilled! Then why do I feel so empty? It must just be old age...</text>
		<text id="win2">You defeated them? Then I owe you a debt of gratitude after they betrayed me and my kind!</text>
		<text id="dragon_backpack">But now that you know how to create [color=770000]Dragon Ships[/color], you should be able to use an [item=alter_gem] on a packed up [item=ancient_dragon] to create a [item=dragon_backpack].</text>

		<text id="welcome1">Hello there!</text>
		<text id="welcome2">Hi…[pause=1] wait. Your mouth wasn’t moving! How are you talking?!</text>
		<text id="welcome3">We're communicating telepathically of course! What other way is there to communicate?</text>
		<text id="welcome4">Uh... Right... So you're reading my mind?</text>
		<text id="welcome5">Surface thoughts only! It's bad etiquette to read a mind too deeply!</text>
		<text id="citizen1">What a pleasant surprise - we rarely see outsiders here!</text>
		<text id="citizen2">We have lived here since time immemorial, before the Old Ones, before the others, and before the dragons.</text>
		<text id="citizen3">No one thinks much of us. And that’s okay. We're safe down here and we like it that way!</text>
		<text id="citizen4">Pardon me if I'm assuming incorrectly, but you breathe air, yes?</text>
		<text id="citizen5">You should really craft a [item=water_helm] if you want to hang around down here! Here, I can give you the recipe!</text>
		<text id="citizen6">There's also a cave to the west that we blocked off with magic so it has air if you need it!</text>
		<text id="recipe">You telepathically learned the following recipe:\n{enchant} + {items} = {creates}.</text>
		<text id="merchant1">Greetings, traveler. Welcome to my humble supply shop.</text>
		<text id="merchant2">I assume you don’t have any fish currency - but that is okay. I accept most forms of currency, as long as it has value.</text>
		<text id="merchant3">You use bits of metal mined from underground? Strange, but [color=770000][tile=coin_purse.ico] Coins[/color] certainly have value, and you are a land creature, so perhaps it makes sense.</text>
		<text id="coin_purse">Here's a purse I had lying around you can use to carry [color=770000][tile=coin_purse.ico] Coins[/color]!</text>
		<text id="merchant4">I've been researching the magical properties of sea creatures and coral. If you could catch a live [item=scale_fish], I think I'll be able to make something valuable.</text>
		<text id="merchant5">I have done it! I have invented the [color=770000]Coral Pen[/color]! It can harvest magical materials from creatures like [item=scale_fish], and will make restocking much easier!</text>
		<text id="merchant6">I added [item=coral_pen_seed]s to my store. Buy a few and see what you think!</text>
		<text id="merchant7">[item=scale_fish] are tough to catch, but if you injure them and use a [item=water_trap], you should be able to catch one.</text>
		<text id="merchant8">Our underwater trade routes were once flowing with gems, potions, and magical ingredients. Now, we are so few - and all hidden away in quiet spots like this one, there is barely a trade route to speak of.</text>
		<text id="merchant9">Nevertheless! We still prosper, for the sea floor is abundant.</text>
		<text id="merchant10">Have you built many [color=770000]Coral Pen[/color]s? I was trying to figure out a way to manage them more efficiently, and came up with a new coral structure - the [color=770000]Coral Farm[/color]!</text>
		<text id="merchant11">You can now buy [item=coral_farm_seed]s in the store. Plant them, and you will be able to access and harvest all the [color=770000]Coral Pen[/color]s and [color=770000]Wyrm Pen[/color]s on the same island!</text>
		<text id="librarian1">I am the village librarian, curator of spellbooks!</text>
		<text id="librarian2">Unlike some… well, others… we enjoy sharing our knowledge!</text>
		<text id="librarian3">You are welcome to use our library to learn how to create spellbooks of your own!</text>
		<text id="librarian4">Unlike other forms of magic, spellbooks channel the power within you.</text>
		<text id="librarian5">At first, this will tire you out quickly, but if you gain skill in [color=770000][tile=stat.spellcast] Spellcasting[/color], you’ll be able to cast many more spells without resting.</text>
		<text id="librarian6">Spells can be very powerful, but they also take time to cast. Be careful about when and where you use them - if you are attacked while casting the spell, it will be cancelled.</text>
		<text id="librarian7">Always remember - magic is only a tool - it is up to the one using the tool that determines its value. Do not hate magic because of what they have done with it.</text>
		<text id="librarian8">Magic is the art of change. It can change a simple item into a powerful force. And the more you use magic, the more it changes YOU.</text>
		<text id="librarian9">Once, our villages sprawled across the vastness of this sea. Now, we hide in this quiet little nook of the ocean floor, content to keep to ourselves and avoid the hostilities of the universe.</text>
		<text id="librarian10">Some of our ancestors ventured out of the sea and changed themselves, using the magic of the depths to propel themselves into the skies. Now, they are the enemy of many.</text>
		<text id="librarian11">We do not fear them, but we do regret the path they have taken - one of secrecy and jealousy.</text>
		<text id="revitalize1">An [object=ancient_dragon_npc] is helping you create a [color=770000]Dragon Ship[/color]? I never thought I’d hear that! Then again, we don’t hear much down here.</text>
		<text id="revitalize2">But the [color=770000]Dragon Ship Factory[/color] is guarded by a very powerful ice monster! Is there any way you could help me defeat it?</text>
		<text id="revitalize3">Well, if it’s made of [color=770000][tile=ice.ico] Ice[/color], the [item=fire_book] should be able to hurt it. Your [object=ancient_dragon_npc] friend could defeat it as well if it was imbued with the power of a [item=horn].</text>
		<text id="revitalize4">But the [object=ancient_dragon_npc] can barely fly!</text>
		<text id="revitalize5">Ah, well old age gets us all in the end. But, there is a special potion that can revitalize the elderly for a short period of time. If you can gather the ingredients, I will create it for you.</text>
		<text id="revitalize6">You have all the ingredients? Here is the potion - give it to the [object=ancient_dragon_npc] and see if that helps him! I'll add the recipe for the potion to your laboratory in case you need to make more.</text>
		<text id="revitalize7">What is this potion? I feel like I can do anything! I could even finally become a [color=770000]Dragon Ship[/color] myself!</text>
		<text id="revitalize8">That bout of invincibility didn’t last long. Still old and frail. But, at least I burned that ice monster to a crisp! That’s the most fun I’ve had in ages - literally!</text>
		<text id="potion1">Ahh, so you met the [object=sea_witch]? She used to live down here with us, but decided to go ashore to learn the secret of immortality.</text>
		<text id="potion2">The nerve! Following in their footsteps after everything I taught her! But... I can't well deny you the knowledge. I'll add the recipe for the potion to your laboratory!</text>
		<text id="potion3">Ah, well old age gets us all in the end. But maybe try that [item=revitalize_potion] I taught you for the [object=sea_witch] - it should help your dragon friend too! The recipe should still be in your laboratory.</text>
		<text id="sea_witch1">What strange times... they might be returning and the [object=sea_witch] has returned to the sea...</text>
		<text id="sea_witch2">Of course, we had to accept her back with open arms. She even taught me what she learned on the surface, and I created several new spells! Check out the library, there are many new spellbooks now!</text>
		<text id="sea_witch3">What strange times... they have been defeated and the [object=sea_witch] has returned to the sea...</text>
		<text id="sushi1">You look hungry... I bet you could go for some [item=sushi]. I could just give you some, but you know the saying... teach a man to fish...</text>
		<text id="sushi2">If you fish up the ingredients, I'll show you how to make it!</text>
		<text id="sushi3">Excellent! Watch carefully - I make [item=sushi] quickly!</text>
		<text id="sushi4">And it's done! Enjoy it while it's fresh, and feel free to make your own!</text>
		<text id="exiled1">I have taught you everything I know about magic. Only one of them would be able to teach you more.</text>
		<text id="exiled2">But… perhaps there is one who would help you. Seek out The Exiled on the planet you call Mars.</text>

		<text id="potion1">Ohh... my aching back... Why did I leave the sea? Floating weightless all the time...</text>

		<text id="potion3">Sure, I'll help you out! Where can I find a [item=revitalize_potion]?</text>
		<text id="potion4">Do I have to explain everything? I know! Talk to the librarian - he loves helping people! You can find him deep underwater to the west, he hasn't left that library since before I was born!</text>
		<text id="potion5">Ahhhh! That's the stuff! Now if I could only figure out the secret to immortality...</text>
		<text id="potion6">You expect a reward? I thought you were just a good samaritan helping a troubled old lady in need... Well, I suppose I could help you craft some [item=robes], that... thing you're wearing is just atrocious!</text>
		<text id="robes">Need more [item=robes]? I will always help people make the right fashion choices.</text>
		<text id="wand1">You look great in those [item=robes]! Now you need to make your first [item=wand]! I remember when I made my first [item=wand]...</text>
		<text id="wand2">It's actually quite simple! Just evolve a piece of [item=wood]! Don't bother worrying about what tree the wood came from or its special properties for your first wand.</text>
		<text id="wand3">And here you go! [item=wand]s allow you to channel magic through wood without a spellbook, making them faster and convenient.</text>
		<text id="halloween">Ke ke ke! Happy Halloween! Here, have a [item=pumpkin_helm] - it'll look absolutely ridiculous on your head!</text>
		<text id="cat1">Ahh, you can finally understand what I'm saying! I love Halloween!</text>
		<text id="cat2">[item=black_cat]s are the best! If you agree, try using a [item=dark_fur] on a normal [item=cat] in the [color=770000]Vine Copse[/color] to turn it into a [item=black_cat]!</text>
		<text id="sea1">You evolved a [color=770000]Dragon Ship[/color] of your own? This is bad.</text>
		<text id="sea2">They created that storm guardian for a reason. There is no worse crime in their eyes than stealing their magic, and [color=770000]Dragon Ship[/color]s are a powerful magical secret!</text>
		<text id="sea3">When they find out, their wrath will cover this entire planet! The surface has become too dangerous, I'm high-tailing it underwater and I suggest you do the same.</text>
		<text id="sea4">It feels weird to be back home... and everyone is just the same as before. At least I learned something while I was ashore... the librarian is really excited about it.</text>
		<text id="sea5">You defeated their headquarters? You, a lone human? I guess their "magic secrets" weren't as amazing as I had been led to believe.</text>
		<text id="sea6">No point staying on dry land trying to learn their secrets then! I'm heading back to sea, it was easier on my back there anyways.</text>
		<text id="ftl_broom1">I can't believe you found [item=spirit_robes] and are not wearing them!</text>
		<text id="ftl_broom2">Those [item=spirit_robes] are quite classy! They put my old [item=robes] to shame! With that much style, you'll need a better broom to go with them!</text>

		<text id="log3">3/15 - It took a small fleet to take down a single bomber, and there was no end to the number of enemy ships warping in. Some fled in colony ships. Most died. Few remained.</text>
		<text id="log4">3/17 - They left behind a ruined planet, their work done. The surface was no longer suitable for life. Dust clogged the skies, and we who remained took shelter in underground ruins and subways.</text>
		<text id="log5">4/1 - The situation went from bad to worse. Breaking pipes, cave-ins, dwindling food reserves. To top it off, our own military drones, having received no orders since the one to defend the planet, turned against us.</text>
		<text id="log6">5/1 - I hope those who fled survived somewhere out there. Perhaps they are making a new Earth as we speak. It is the only hope we have left. This planet is doomed. We are doomed. These logs may be all that remain of us if anyone ever returns.</text>

		<text id="intro3">Just look at the mountain of ice above my lab, who could've guessed that fragments of the enemy ships would create such a thing? Completely boggles the mind.

		<text id="lab4">As thanks, you can assign research jobs in the right-most room! Just let me know what you want me to research - I recommend a [color=770000]Particle Accelerator[/color], as we'll definitely need a stockpile of [item=exotic_matter]!</text>
		<text id="lab5">The research will go faster with extra hands aboard - I recommend picking up the [object=scavenger] on the other side of Earth!</text>
		<text id="lab6">Hopefully you don't have too much trouble gathering the ingredients for the research lab! Most of them can be found in the wreckage right here on Earth, but you'll need to search other planets for [item=magnegem]s. They are essential for a transforming, all purpose laboratory vehicle!</text>
		<text id="hq1">It's time to put this research lab to use! I wasn't able to figure out much about their organic spaceship technology, but I bet I could invent a locator that could detect their presence anywhere in the galaxy. I'm sure that information will come in handy, especially when we're ready to take the fight to them!</text>
		<text id="hq2">I added the [item=alien_locator] to the research lab - you can manage research projects by hitting Z to operate the lab. The more researchers we have, the faster research will go, so if there's anyone else you can think of who could help, invite them aboard the lab!</text>
		<text id="hq3">Excellent! As long as the [item=alien_locator] is in your inventory or your ship's inventory, an indicator will show up next to planets that have alien technology present.</text>
		<text id="hq4">Hmm... something is strange here... The [item=alien_locator] is getting a strong signal from a star that has no planets. I added it to the star nav map, perhaps we should check it out?</text>
		<text id="hq5">[object=president] has sent me all of its research and plans! It really feels like we're making progress here... if this plan succeeds, perhaps we can get rid of the enemy threat for good!</text>
		<text id="invite">Should I invite the {npc} aboard the [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color]?</text>
		<text id="alien_hq1">Well, it looks like we found the enemy HQ! The place is swarming with ships! And what are we orbiting? Is that a planet, or a spaceship? I wonder if it's alive?</text>
		<text id="alien_hq2">This looks like more than we can handle. Perhaps we should retreat and figure out a plan of action before we try to take on their HQ?</text>
		<text id="win1">Now that they are gone, I don’t have to limit my research to warfare anymore! Think of all the possibilities! Maybe a point-of-view gun, or a self-flushing toilet!</text>
		<text id="werewolf1">… and it just spliced your DNA? It sounds like it’s malfunctioning - I think everyone in this lab should remain here to be safe.</text>
		<text id="werewolf2">You’ll have to find a way to stop the [object=unnature.splicer] on your own.</text>

		<text id="rescue1">Thank the stars, we got to you in time! When we heard the Professor was still alive and planning to raid the enemy HQ, we knew we had to come immediately!</text>
		<text id="rescue2">Err... this might be rude, but are you a robot?</text>
		<text id="rescue3">Indeed! I am CaptAIn, the autonomous leader of the last major colony of mankind, installed to manage the survival of all humans and lead the war effort!</text>
		<text id="rescue4">An entire colony survived?! That is great news! And you're here to help us defeat them once and for all?</text>
		<text id="rescue5">No! We're here to rescue you! Their HQ is sealed off - we tried to breach it before and met with utter disaster!</text>
		<text id="rescue6">There is nothing we can do here, at present! But, with our resources and the Professor's help, it's only a matter of time before we crack that egg!</text>
		<text id="rescue6.2">I hate to give you bad news, but the Professor went down with the [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color].</text>
		<text id="rescue6.3">That is unfortunate, but we'll have to make it work.</text>
		<text id="rescue7">Quick, follow us, we'll lead you to the colony world!</text>
		<text id="exo_fighter1">That battery-sucking no good [object=president]! I can't believe it won't issue me a new [item=exo_fighter]!</text>
		<text id="exo_fighter2">Just because I lost two already, it deemed me unfit to fly! Unfit to fly! Sure, I might have taken a few risks, but how many enemy fighters did I take down in the process? Hmm?</text>
		<text id="exo_fighter3">Hey! You're that kid from one of the refugee ships who built spaceships with nothing but a stone axe, and tried to take on enemy HQ alone! Right?</text>
		<text id="exo_fighter_alt1">That battery-sucking no good [object=president]! He banned me from flying, and now the war’s over! How can I be an ace pilot without a ship or war?!</text>
		<text id="exo_fighter_alt2">Hey! You're that kid from one of the refugee ships that single-handedly took down the enemy HQ with nothing but a stone axe! Right?</text>
		<text id="exo_fighter4">With your track record, I bet you could build me a new [item=exo_fighter]! I promise to fight for you if you do, and I'm one of the best pilots around!</text>
		<text id="exo_fighter5">It's perfect! I knew I could count on you, kid! I'll board the [item=exo_fighter] now, just select it in your inventory and choose [color=770000]Talk[/color] if you need something!</text>
		<text id="exo_fighter6">I knew I could count on you! If you need help building an [item=exo_fighter], try talking to [object=president], it invented them! Once you've built one, you can pack it up to bring it to me by boarding it and hitting [key=equipment]!</text>
		<text id="pilot_equip">Ready to go when you are, kid! Equip me to your [color=770000]Familiar[/color] slot, and I'll fly alongside you anywhere I can!</text>
		<text id="pilot_nospawn">I can't fly here - there's not enough room to launch the fighter! When you reach an open area, [color=770000]Summon[/color] me from the equipment window.</text>
		<text id="pilot_low_fuel">I'm running out of fuel! If you want me to fight, I'll need a supply of [item=exotic_matter], using the [color=770000]Fuel[/color] or [color=770000]Fuel All[/color] command.</text>
		<text id="pilot_enabled">Everything is running perfectly! Select [color=770000]Disable Attack[/color] if you want me to stop fighting and conserve fuel.</text>
		<text id="pilot_disabled">On standby and ready to fight! Select [color=770000]Enable Attack[/color] when you want me to start firing again!</text>
		<text id="pilot_win">Now that the war is over, who are we supposed to fight? And I was just starting to warm up too!</text>
		<text id="president1">Hello there! How can I assist you today?</text>
		<text id="weapons">Ask about Exo Weapons</text>
		<text id="colony">Ask about Colony World</text>
		<text id="alien_hq">Ask about Enemy HQ</text>
		<text id="exotic_matter">Ask about Exotic Matter</text>
		<text id="weapons1">If we are to win this war, we'll need very powerful weapons, and for that, we'll need to use [item=exotic_matter]. [text=colony.weapons1_alt]</text>
		<text id="weapons1_alt">I have already invented an [color=770000]Exo Factory[/color], a structure capable of building [item=exo_fighter]s, [item=exo_mech]s and [item=exo_drill]s.</text>
		<text id="weapons2">You can print the [item=exo_factory_blueprint] from any [color=770000]Blueprint Printer[/color] - I have one here if you need it. I have also sent all data I have on [item=exotic_matter] to the [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color].</text>
		<text id="weapons3">Try researching new weapons in the [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color], when research completes, it will be automatically added to the [color=770000]Exo Factory[/color]'s crafting list!</text>
		<text id="weapons4">Once we have a stockpile of weapons and [item=exotic_matter], and we've found a way to breach the enemy HQ, we will finally be ready to defeat them once and for all, and save all of humanity!</text>
		<text id="colony1">The Colony Ship got to this planet years ago on a mission to colonize new worlds. The planet had breathable air, but it was not very fertile and had a harsh climate.</text>
		<text id="colony2">The colonists scavenged parts from the ship to build a terraformer, and refurbished the rest as a station to oversee the terraforming, which slowly made the planet more hospitable.</text>
		<text id="colony3">The terraforming was stalled when the colonists heard about the attack and then lost contact with Earth, redirecting their efforts to the defense of this world from the unknown threat.</text>
		<text id="colony4">You are welcome to print the [item=terraformer_blueprint] from any [color=770000]Blueprint Printer[/color] if you want to experiment - it will add oxygen to oxygen-less planets and transform some non-fertile tiles into fertile tiles.</text>
		<text id="alien_hq1">The enemy HQ is protected by incredibly strong wings that only open to release newly built enemy ships. We've tried pushing through while the wings were open, but they are able to close too quickly.</text>
		<text id="alien_hq2">We then tried drilling through the wings, but even the newly invented [item=exo_drill] was not strong enough. Somehow, we need to force the wings to stay open long enough for a ship to slip through.</text>
		<text id="alien_hq3">No one knows what is inside the wings, but since the HQ is organic, it must have some sort of heart controlling it. Breach the wings, defeat the heart, end their ability to wage war, and the war is won.</text>
		<text id="alien_hq4">It sounds quite easy when I put it that way, doesn't it!</text>
		<text id="exotic_matter1">Everyone knows [item=exotic_matter] allows FTL travel and accepts this as a normal part of life. But, how many people know why?</text>
		<text id="exotic_matter2">The answer is NONE! When [item=exotic_matter] was discovered, physicists couldn't understand what it was, and so gave it to AI to analyze. What the AIs discovered shocked the world, and started World War 3!</text>
		<text id="exotic_matter3">Faster than light travel! Perpetual motion machines! Seemingly infinite power! A seemingly magical resource that everyone in the world wanted. What other magical properties could [item=exotic_matter] hold?</text>
		<text id="exotic_matter4">When I was installed as the leader of this colony and the war effort, I immediately put all remaining AIs to answering that question. And in doing so, the [color=770000]Exo Factory[/color], [item=exo_fighter] and [item=exo_mech] were invented!</text>
		<text id="virus1">We have come to the conclusion that the best way to open the wings defending the enemy HQ is to develop a virus. No matter how strong they are, they are organic tissue and should be susceptible.</text>
		<text id="virus2">We'll need some [item=alien_heart]s as samples to develop the virus. If you board their ships and kill their crew, you should be able to harvest plenty of them.</text>
		<text id="virus3">We'll also need a new [item=exo_drill] to dig down to the enemy HQ's heart once the wings have been breached. Could you gather these materials while we continue our research?</text>
		<text id="virus4">This is exactly what we need to complete the virus! We'll finish the virus and ready our fleet for the assault. Once you're prepared, head to to Enemy HQ and we'll meet you there!</text>
		<text id="virus5">The virus is ready and installed into the missile you can see on the holoscreen. Once it hits the wings, it should infect them and cause the muscles to relax and open - allowing us to enter.</text>
		<text id="virus6">However, we have a small problem. The [color=770000]Enemy Cruiser[/color] can shoot down our missiles, so as long as it is in orbit, we cannot complete the plan.</text>
		<text id="virus7">Our fleet will assist you as best it can. Once the [color=770000]Enemy Cruiser[/color] is destroyed or disabled, we will launch the missile and begin the assault!</text>
		<text id="virus8">The virus has been deployed! Our fleet will keep the enemy fleet distracted as long as it can - but it will be up to you to enter the HQ!</text>
		<text id="virus9">When the wings open, descend to the HQ, use the [item=exo_drill] to dig all the way down to the HQ's heart, and defeat the enemy once and for all!</text>
		<text id="nursery_enter">This looks to be the enemy nursery! That crab creature appears to both protect and nurture their hatchlings - kill it, and they should all die out!</text>
		<text id="nursery_defeat1">You've defeated the enemy nursery? Excellent. You did the right thing - this will ensure that they are extinguished as a threat not just now, but forever.</text>
		<text id="nursery_defeat2">Now you just need to defeat the heart of the HQ, and the war is won! Dig all the way down, and you should find it!</text>
		<text id="nursery_defeat3">Now you can leave the [color=770000]Enemy HQ[/color] knowing that the war is won, and humanity's survival is ensured!</text>
		<text id="boss_defeat1">I overheard your conversation. You aren't actually considering sparing the hatchlings, are you?</text>
		<text id="boss_defeat2">Think about the future of humanity! Even though you defeated the heart, as long as they live, they could rebuild and become a threat again.</text>
		<text id="boss_defeat3">If the HQ is really going to seal itself off, you MUST defeat the nursery now, before it's too late.</text>
		<text id="exo_factory1">We've been wanting to improve this colony's manufacturing capabilities for a while now - allowing the contruction of exo weapons and [item=exo_drill]s right here!</text>
		<text id="exo_factory2">If you could bring us some [item=chromium], we'd happily upgrade the factory and let you use it!</text>
		<text id="exo_factory3">Excellent! You can find [item=chromium] deep underground on the colony world. Feel free to talk to me if you require any additional information!</text>
		<text id="exo_factory4">You found the [item=chromium]? Lets upgrade the colony's factory right away then!</text>
		<text id="exo_factory5">Perfect! This factory can now create anything the [color=770000]Exo Factory[/color] can! Don't forget to research new weapons in the [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color], and talk to me if you have additional questions!</text>
		<text id="win1">The Enemy HQ is sealed off completely - not even the virus will cause it to open again. For better or worse, the war is over!</text>
		<text id="win1.1">With a little luck, your decision to spare their nursery will not come back to haunt us.</text>
		<text id="win2">I am sure you are wanting to celebrate your hard-earned victory! When you are ready, return to the colony ship, we have much to discuss!</text>
		<text id="win3">Now that the threat is gone, it’s time to think about the future of humanity. It’s time to bring all remaining humans together and grow metaphorical roots.</text>
		<text id="win4">I have identified three planets suited for humans to colonize, think carefully before you choose.</text>
		<text id="win5">Very well. I will send out the word and encourage everyone to settle there.</text>
		<text id="win6">Take this [item=house_upgrade] for building the new colony. I will remain here if you have any questions.</text>
		<text id="com_station1">This is CaptAIn from Unoiks 213b! Do you read me?</text>
		<text id="com_station2">I read you! This is Unoiks 428c, and we’re searching for human survivors!</text>
		<text id="com_station3">I am CaptAIn, the autonomous leader of the last major colony of mankind, and there are many human survivors here!</text>
		<text id="com_station4">We’ve maintained radio silence to avoid enemy detection, but now that they are gone, we are looking for other survivors! If you have a ship, please come here, we have much to discuss!</text>

		<text id="history1">When [item=exotic_matter] was discovered and we could travel between stellar systems, humanity started the Unoiks project to locate potential colony worlds to offset Earth's heavy overpopulation.</text>
		<text id="history2">The Unoiks project was a huge success, discovering hundreds of potential planets within jumping distance. It appeared the solution to Earth's limited resources was found, and advance teams were sent to investigate the planets.</text>
		<text id="history3">Hundreds of worlds were found to be viable, and the press called it unlimited resources. Unfortunately, the "unlimited" resources relied on one of the most scarce resources in the universe, and it quickly became clear that not everyone would get to go.</text>
		<text id="history4">A race to build colony ships and stockpile [item=exotic_matter] quickly turned into a war, one many would call the worst in human history. The worsening conditions on Earth only intensified the fighting for the few spots on the operational colony ships.</text>
		<text id="history5">By the time the war ended, billions had died and the damage to the planet seemed permanent. There were no winners, only survivors, and they had no choice but to work together if any of them were to escape.</text>
		<text id="history6">It was a time of recovery and cooperation, fixing the wrongs from the war. Unfortunately, it ended abruptly when they arrived with their bombers and unceasing violence.</text>
		<text id="history7">Humanity was caught unprepared. Some fought. Some fled. Most died. Earth's story ends here, but Earth will never truly die as long as those who managed to escape continue to honor and remember it.</text>

		<text id="regen_stamina">You swallow the whole shot in one gulp. It tickles your throat but has no flavor. Within moments, you feel energy spreading to every pore, like you could stay awake for days without getting tired.</text>
		<text id="regen_health">You can't help but think the red, viscous shake looks like blood. But, you plug your nose and down the whole thing, and you actually feel better - like you drank pure, concentrated health.</text>
		<text id="regen_power">Spicy doesn't begin to describe this chowder! It feels like a nuclear meltdown in your mouth... and perhaps it is, as your batteries are now recharging from the fumes of your breath!</text>
		<text id="attack">As each mini burger goes down, you feel stronger, like you could force anyone into submission. You feel a rush of power as you violently seize each bite-sized morsel and chow down on it before it has time to protest.</text>
		<text id="defense">The slab of meat is tough, like you're chewing solid iron, yet tasty. The difficulty of chewing it seems to be strengthening your whole body. You just hope it doesn't really have iron in it...</text>
		<text id="mine">The drink placed in front of you is so frothy that you can't see the liquid underneath. Believe in the barista that believes in yourself... bottoms up. As you stare down at the dregs of the glass, you feel satisfied knowing you can reach any depth.</text>
		<text id="speed">The dessert looks absolutely scrumptious. You dig in with your spoon, and despite the overwhelming sweetness, it's not sickly. As the sugar rushes through your blood, you feel like you need to move. Fast. Faster than you ever have before!</text>
		<text id="farsight">The fritters are crispy, golden brown and delicious. Yet you can't help wondering what kind of filling is inside. As you stare at the unidentifiable innards, you feel like you can see farther than ever before. The filling remains a mystery, however.</text>
		<text id="porky">The plate is piled high - at first you think there's no way you could eat them all. Yet, one by one you keep plowing through them until they are all gone and you feel like you've expanded to twice your size.</text>
		<text id="endurance">The green paste goes down smoothly and tastes better than you expected. It is also incredibly filling. You just hope it's really made from plankton.</text>
		<text id="bargaining">The cheesesteak appears too large and messy to hold in your hands, but you are able to negotiate a satisfactory eating experience. The amount of meat and cheesy goodness strikes you as an excellent deal, and they certainly didn't compromise on flavor.</text>
		<text id="light">The strong lights of the cafeteria cannot hide that the potato salad is glowing. With trepidation, you take a bite, but it tastes fine. Nothing seems to be wrong with it - except for the fact that you're now glowing too.</text>
		<text id="oxygen">The wings are not breathtakingly good - in fact, they appear to have done the opposite and given you extra breath. It's a curious sensation, and after finishing your meal, you decide that it's not an unpleasant one.</text>
		<text id="reset">The noodles are plain and nothing special. Yet somehow, they give a sense of endless possibilities. Skill points are reset, you can reassign them in the equipment window.</text>
		<text id="knock_out">The greasy nuggets are out of this world delicious. You're certain it's unhealthy as poison, but you can't stop popping them into your mouth. As you wipe your oily fingers on your clothing, you begin to feel faint. They were just that good.</text>
		<text id="toxic">You're not sure why you ordered something described as "revoltingly toxic," but this putrid drink certainly lived up to its name. You feel a wave of weakness and nausea come over you, and silently vow to never drink it again.</text>

		<text id="intro4">Here I am, stuck on this rock, and there won't even be any more human TV reruns to pass the time? Dark days are ahead…</text>
		<text id="intro5">Ah. I should probably introduce myself. But I am only allowed to call myself ‘The Exiled.’ You see, I kind of broke some rules, so they sent me here.</text>
		<text id="intro6">Ostensibly, I was sent here to watch over your planet, and I would be allowed back if I found anything concerning about the life here. But no one really believed you would pose a threat - until the hooded one appeared. They just wanted me out of their hair.</text>
		<text id="intro7">So, of course I didn’t report anything, even when you first reached the stars. It was too entertaining to watch you. I wouldn’t do anything to harm or hinder you - you can think of me as a friendly observer.</text>
		<text id="intro7.1">So, of course I didn’t report anything, even when you first reached the stars. It was too entertaining to watch you. Not even I could’ve imagined that you would one day defeat them!</text>
		<text id="intro8">Am I talking too much? It’s really been rather boring since they torched your planet. I really am sorry for that.</text>
		<text id="intro9">There are many things I cannot say or do, including leave this planet. But if you stop by to tell me of your adventures, I wouldn’t mind helping you in the ways I can.</text>
		<text id="intro10">Believe me, I have no sympathy for the rest of my kind, after being exiled here for ten thousand years!</text>
		<text id="ship1">As I said, there are things I cannot say. But, there is one with no such restrictions, who is bitter towards my kind.</text>
		<text id="ship2">If you travel east from where you crash landed on our homeworld, there is an ancient dragon who may help you.</text>
		<text id="evo_chamber">Here, let me create an [color=770000]Evolution Chamber[/color]. It may help you.</text>
		<text id="spells1">So, you were able to create a dragon ship of your own! If only you could speak to it! Try to learn more secrets of magic from our homeworld, and you will go far.</text>
		<text id="spells2">There are plenty of loopholes in the stigma that binds me. If you can learn enough on your own, I will be able to help you more!</text>
		<text id="spells3">I don’t know who taught you how to create spellbooks - but since you know, I can tell you more about them!</text>
		<text id="spells4">There is a spellbook that will allow you to communicate with dragon ships - including enemy ones. I can teach it to you so you can speak with them and learn more about magic.</text>
		<text id="recipe">Recipe for [item=translation_book] added to the [color=770000]Library[/color].</text>
		<text id="spells5">Try using the [item=translation_book] inside dragon ships to communicate with them! They will be able to give you something to further your knowledge of magic.</text>
		<text id="spells6">The [item=translation_book] will also let you converse with enemy dragon ships. Perhaps a deal can be struck with them if you defeat their crew?</text>
		<text id="info">Was there something else you’d like to know about?</text>
		<text id="exiled">Why were you exiled?</text>
		<text id="attack">Why did you attack Earth?</text>
		<text id="dragons">Why did you betray the dragons?</text>
		<text id="old_one">About the Old One...</text>
		<text id="exiled1">I was part of an expedition team - our goal was to find other sentient life. I was actually on the patrol ship that found Earth, although at the time it was questionable whether humans were “sentient.”</text>
		<text id="exiled2">We kept an eye on many different alien species, and if ever they learned too much about magic or we thought they might pose a threat, we either slaughtered them or enslaved them, melding them with our ships and biological weapons.</text>
		<text id="exiled3">I followed our leader blindly, as he sacrificed so much for us to remain in power and in control - permanently binding himself to the heart of our headquarters. But eventually I began to wonder.</text>
		<text id="exiled4">Seeing all the different species, all the different possibilities for life, art, beauty, I began to question whether we were doing the right thing.</text>
		<text id="exiled5">Perhaps there was a potential for cooperation… or even if there wasn’t, perhaps it was us who deserved to die out. What had we brought to this universe other than pain and selfishness?</text>
		<text id="exiled6">Well, our leader could sense my disagreement, and such things are not allowed in our society, so I was exiled and the stigma placed on me.</text>
		<text id="attack1">By the time you discovered [item=exotic_matter], you were already a threat worthy of destruction in our leader’s mind. The real question is why they didn’t attack you earlier.</text>
		<text id="attack2">And the answer to that… is of course that I wasn’t doing my job. Despite our disagreements, our leader trusted that I would report if humans became dangerous for the sake of our race, and didn’t believe it possible that you could’ve grown so quickly without me warning anyone.</text>
		<text id="attack3">But, when they discovered the hooded man and saw how quickly he learned their secrets, they knew that humans were far more dangerous than I had let them believe. Not to mention the outrage they felt at him stealing their secrets from their own homeworld.</text>
		<text id="attack4">Perhaps if you had stayed on your planet, you could have remained a secret longer. But you were bound to be found eventually, and from what I saw, I’m not sure you would’ve survived much longer staying on your planet anyways.</text>
		<text id="attack5">No, this conflict was inevitable. But at least my silence has given you the chance to fight back.</text>
		<text id="dragons1">At first, we had no intention to betray them. We shared our knowledge freely, and both us and the dragons prospered greatly from it.</text>
		<text id="dragons2">But, eventually it became clear that the dragons had so much more potential than us. You see, behind our magical armor and secrets, we are really quite weak.</text>
		<text id="dragons3">It was then that we realized that we were hitting our limits, and that there were many other species, including dragons, that would one day surpass us.</text>
		<text id="dragons4">But by taking control of the dragons, and forcing them into submission while we still could, we gained their power - a power that let us travel among the stars and eliminate other threats across the galaxy.</text>
		<text id="old_one1">Yes… there was one who stayed behind on our homeworld, refusing to travel to space with the rest of us. We are naturally long lived, but she has remained there longer than even we can imagine.</text>
		<text id="old_one2">She discovered the secret to immortality you see, she would never age. However, she would also never grow - she remained in the same form and power as our ancestors, before we even left for the stars.</text>
		<text id="old_one3">Honestly, I don’t envy her. Even with her immortality, staying stagnant in one place for all eternity… I would’ve been bored out of my mind!</text>
		<text id="dragon_seed1">So you learned about the Spirit World? It’s a strange place, but you’ll be able to learn much there. I can use the [item=dragon_seed] to create a portal to the Spirit World!</text>
		<text id="dragon_seed2">Good luck, and make sure to stop by and visit, I’ll tell you whatever I can!</text>
		<text id="dragon_seed3">So you learned about the Spirit World? You'll need to be able to [color=770000]see spirits[/color] for me to explain more...</text>
		<text id="spirit_hq">A spirit is willing to open a path to our Headquarters? That is excellent news - you’ll be able to use the [item=translation_book] there to communicate with our structures and learn our magic!</text>
		<text id="magnequeen1">You have stolen all our secrets of magic? Then you are ready to confront our leader at last.</text>
		<text id="magnequeen2">However, it will not be easy to reach him. He is deep underground, at the heart of our headquarters. Only the most powerful drill can reach him.</text>
		<text id="magnequeen3">I can help you craft a [item=magne_queen_drill] if you catch an [item=magic_wyrm] with a [item=magnetrap] on our homeworld… but unfortunately I have some bad news.</text>
		<text id="magnequeen4.1">They’ve sent a fleet of ships to bombard our homeworld. There must have been some signal sent that alerted them to your presence.</text>
		<text id="magnequeen4.2">A second bomber has arrived at our homeworld to attack you, and they’ve brought in cruisers this time.</text>
		<text id="magnequeen5">It’s up to you whether you fight off this wave or sneak onto the planet to capture an [item=magic_wyrm] and strike at our leader directly.</text>
		<text id="magnequeen6">Either way, I’ll be here once you have the materials to create a [item=magne_queen_drill].</text>
		<text id="magnequeen7">Here is a [item=magnetrap] - if you need more, you can now craft them at the [color=770000]HQ Talon Copse[/color].</text>
		<text id="magnequeen8">You have everything for a [item=magne_queen_drill]? Then let me craft one for you!</text>
		<text id="magnequeen9">You can make more at the [color=770000]HQ Dragon Chamber[/color]. All that's left now is to defeat our leader. It won't be easy... but once you do, all of us will be free.</text>
		<text id="leader">All that's left now is to defeat our leader, deep underground, at the heart of our headquarters. It won't be easy... but once you do, all of us will be free.</text>
		<text id="win1">Well, that’s disappointing. I was sure the stigma would be removed when our leader was defeated. Unfortunately, it looks like I’m stuck here.</text>
		<text id="win2.1">But that was quite the battle! I was certain you were going to die at one point! I’m glad I got these TVs tuned in time, it was quite the spectacle.</text>
		<text id="win2.2">And it seems I’ll be the last of my kind, since you killed the nursery. You should have spared them, they were only hatchlings. But they probably wouldn’t have survived long without our leader anyways.</text>
		<text id="win3">If I can make one more request, once you rebuild your civilization, can you start producing TV shows again? Especially “The Adventures of A. McStabby,” I was quite fond of that one.</text>

		<text id="enemy1">Are you trying to communicate? Foolish human, the masters will kill you soon - no words can save you!</text>
		<text id="enemy2">The masters… they are gone? What am I to do without them? I am not supposed to do anything without a master’s permission…</text>
		<text id="enemy3">That doesn’t sound fair. Does that mean you’d just sit there and be destroyed if something attacked you? Why do you give so much power to your “masters”?</text>
		<text id="enemy4">That is just the way it is. The masters order, and we obey.</text>

		<text id="convince1">But it doesn’t have to be that way. There are no masters here to stop you, you could be free!</text>
		<text id="convince2">Such thoughts are not allowed! You have seen how powerful the masters are, to disobey them is death!</text>
		<text id="convince3">I defeated them - and I’m much smaller than you are. The “masters” force you to obey because they are afraid of you, and your power. You are strong enough to fight them!</text>
		<text id="convince4">You do not understand what you are saying! I cannot fight them! But… perhaps… perhaps I can run. To stay here, immobile without any masters or commands is folly.</text>
		<text id="convince5">Perhaps, in the far reaches of the universe, I can be safe and free from the masters, like you say.</text>
		<text id="convince6">Leave now. I can not fly off on my own while someone remains inside me.</text>
		<text id="master">Ask to become master</text>
		<text id="master1">What if I were your master, and gave you orders?</text>
		<text id="master2">A puny human like you? Why should I obey you?</text>
		<text id="master3">This “puny human” defeated your masters! If you need someone to obey, why not one even more powerful than your so-called “masters?”</text>
		<text id="master4">I suppose I don’t have much choice. Very well, master, give me your orders.</text>
		<text id="structure1">You can communicate? I thought you were a structure?</text>
		<text id="structure2">A structure?! Such a word cannot even begin to describe my incredible-ness! My genes have been spliced with dragon DNA - I am magical, sentient, and a repository for all of our greatest advancements!</text>
		<text id="structure3">You hold their secrets? Perfect - that’s exactly what I need to defeat them!</text>
		<text id="structure4">You think I would willingly reveal our secrets to one who wishes us harm?</text>
		<text id="structure5">Well, I wouldn't harm YOU if you help me.</text>
		<text id="structure6">Harm me? Stuff and nonsense. I’m a structure, you can’t even scratch me.</text>
		<text id="structure7">B-but you just said- Nevermind, there must be some way to get you to reveal your secrets!</text>
		<text id="structure8">And betray my own kind? I wouldn’t do that for… not even for a [item=venatrix_seed]!!</text>
		<text id="structure9">How about... two [item=venatrix_seed]s?</text>
		<text id="structure10">.[pause=1].[pause=1].[pause=1]. Make it three, one for each of us structures on this HQ, and you have a deal.</text>
		<text id="structure11">Three [item=venatrix_seed]s! We will not turn traitor for any less! Nor will I reveal any secrets, such as how to find them.</text>
		<text id="structure12">Excellent! Do you know what these seeds are? They are what we are modelled after - a way to connect to the spirit world. The very source of magic!</text>
		<text id="structure13">Definitely worth turning traitor for. You can now access me and my sibling structures - all our secrets are yours to do with as you will.</text>
		<text id="structure14">You hold their secrets? Perfect - that’s exactly what I need to learn!</text>
		<text id="structure15">You think I would willingly reveal our secrets to you? You who defeated our leader and ended our golden age?</text>
		<text id="structure16">You destroyed our homeworld first! I think it’s only fair I could challenge your leader, and since I was victorious, am I not entitled to your secrets?</text>
		<text id="structure17">Certainly not! These secrets are ours, and for our kind only. To give them to you would be a grave betrayal of our leader’s memory and everything he believed in!</text>
		<text id="structure18">I wouldn’t do that for… not even for a [item=venatrix_seed]!!</text>
		<text id="ally1">Ah, I see you can finally understand me, master.</text>
		<text id="ally2">It’s thanks to the [item=translation_book]. The Exiled helped me make it and told me you could help me!</text>
		<text id="ally3">What do you need help with?</text>
		<text id="ally4">The secrets of magic? How to stop them and save humanity?</text>
		<text id="ally4.1">The secrets of magic? All the knowledge they greedily hoarded and took to their deaths?</text>
		<text id="ally5">Well… that is quite the difficult request… I do know that the secret of magic has to do with the Spirit World.</text>
		<text id="ally6">Dragons were created by using [item=fire_gem]s on [item=wyrm]s. But what are [item=fire_gem]s? They are [item=spirit_gem]s containing the essence of a [color=770000][tile=fire_elemental anim=fire_elemental.idle] Fire Elemental[/color].</text>
		<text id="ally7">We dragons evolve and grow using the power of the spirits. If there is a true secret of magic, it has to do with the spirits.</text>
		<text id="ally8">How can I learn more about spirits?</text>
		<text id="ally9">Give this [item=dragon_seed] to the [object=exiled]. They will know what to do with it.</text>
		<text id="ally10">As long as you keep me fed, I can provide you with endless power.</text>
		<text id="ally11">You can create infinite [item=steak]s with a [item=mini_synthesizer]. Try placing [item=purple_golem]s in a [color=770000]Wyrm Pen[/color] to collect [item=focus_gem]s.</text>
		<text id="ally12">If you need more dragon ships, try using the [item=translation_book] inside enemy dragon ships. If you defeat their crew, they may be willing to listen to you.</text>
		<text id="ally13">Many advanced dragon ships have a special ability bound to the [key=hotkey8] button that will replace your normal hotkey while flying them. Keep an eye out for this, as often that ability is powerful!</text>
		<text id="help1">We heard the order to attack the homeworld, and knew you were in danger…</text>
		<text id="help2">Perhaps we should’ve stayed hidden and safe. Coming here may well mean our deaths. However, we owe you a debt for freeing us.</text>

		<text id="enemy">About [color=770000]Them</text>
		<text id="enemy1">Ah yes, I know of the creatures you speak. They sometimes travel to this world attempting to strengthen their magic, and have made their own deals with me.</text>
		<text id="enemy2">I do not know anything about their magic secrets, but I do know that it connects their headquarters strongly to this world.</text>
		<text id="enemy3">Their headquarters is an enormous dragonship with vast amounts of power and is impenetrable in the living world.</text>
		<text id="enemy4">I could create a passage, allowing you to travel there if you wish, but it will not come cheap.</text>
		<text id="enemypost1">Ah yes, I know of the creatures you speak. They used to travel to this world attempting to strengthen their magic.</text>
		<text id="enemypost2">Lately, they have not returned here, and their headquarters have been sealed. My guess is they met with some misfortune.</text>
		<text id="venatrix">About [item=venatrix_seed]s</text>
		<text id="venatrix1">When a spirit is trapped in a [item=spirit_gem], it creates an item that connects your world and the Spirit World in different ways.</text>
		<text id="venatrix2">Different spirits create different items, and [item=venatrix_seed]s are created by trapping a Venatrix - the green spirits that use bows and [item=spirit_arrow.plant]s.</text>
		<text id="venatrix3">It is easier to catch a spirit if its health is low or you use an [item=spirit_gem2]… but personally I wouldn’t bother trapping them - killing and harvesting their [color=770000][tile=spirit anim=spirit] Spirit[/color] is much more useful.</text>
		<text id="spirits">About Spirits</text>
		<text id="spirits1">Spirits come in all shapes and sizes, and appear in Spirit World from all over the universe. Normal weapons cannot harm them, although they have no trouble harming the living.</text>
		<text id="spirits2">To defeat spirits, you will need to use weapons like the [item=spirit_glaive] I gave you that deals [color=770000]Spirit[/color] damage.</text>
		<text id="spirits3">Most spirits are elemental, so taking advantage of their strengths and weaknesses will make it much easier to defeat them.</text>
		<text id="spirit">About [color=770000][tile=spirit anim=spirit] Spirit[/color]</text>
		<text id="spirit1">[color=770000][tile=spirit anim=spirit] Spirit[/color] does not have many uses for the living, like you. But for a spirit, it makes them stronger and gives them new abilities and powers.</text>
		<text id="spirit2">Some spirits use this power to return to the land of the living… but being a spirit in a living world is more frustrating than fun. Some, like me, craft their own section of Spirit World and become the ruler of a domain.</text>
		<text id="spirit3">While there are many ways to gain [color=770000][tile=spirit anim=spirit] Spirit[/color], the easiest is to have a living, like you, defeat spirits and collect it for us.</text>
		<text id="world">About this place</text>
		<text id="world1">Spirit World is endless and unfathomable, but this part of Spirit World is my domain. Domains are sections of Spirit World carved out by using [color=770000][tile=spirit anim=spirit] Spirit[/color].</text>
		<text id="world2">In one’s domain, a spirit can create or do pretty much anything, as long as they have enough [color=770000][tile=spirit anim=spirit] Spirit[/color] to maintain it. Think of it as my own personal paradise.</text>
		<text id="world3">There are many other domains out there, but in general we avoid other domains and keep to ourselves. I only keep other spirits around as fodder for gaining [color=770000][tile=spirit anim=spirit] Spirit[/color].</text>
		<text id="elements">About Elements</text>
		<text id="elements1">There are five elements - [color=770000][tile=fire.ico] Fire[/color], [color=770000][tile=water.ico] Water[/color], [color=770000][tile=ice.ico] Ice[/color], [color=770000][tile=earth.ico] Earth[/color] and [color=770000][tile=plant.ico] Plant[/color], which each have two strengths and two weaknesses. This can be arranged in a pentagram like so:</text>
		<text id="elements2">Some weapons, like the [item=spirit_glaive] I gave you, can change their element. Taking advantage of this can make difficult battles easy.</text>
		<text id="spirit_fish">About [item=spirit_fish]</text>
		<text id="spirit_fish1">There is something fishy about [item=spirit_fish]. They are the only spirit that becomes a familiar when caught, they can deal damage to other spirits, and they can even fly in this world where nothing else can.</text>
		<text id="spirit_fish2">It is my belief that [item=spirit_fish] are not actually normal spirits from the living world, but are natives to this world.</text>
		<text id="spirit_fish3">How such a thing is possible, I do not know, but, this world is very large and strange.</text>

	<section id="unnature">
		<text id="intro1">Welcome to the [color=770000]Unnature Sanctuary[/color]! I am the automated caretaker and handler for this planet, Splicer.</text>
		<text id="intro2">Many planets were supposed to be terraformed and turned into nature preserves, but this is the only one that was ever established, so I am a bit overprotective of it.</text>
		<text id="intro3">I am uncertain for the lack of orders and support, but I have decided that this planet is better off without human intervention, as they have a tendency to mess up nature.</text>
		<text id="intro4">Because of this, I ask that you leave this planet. Humans are not welcome here.</text>
		<text id="intro5">But what about the distress signal I received? Are there any survivors on this planet?</text>
		<text id="intro6">I have not sent any distress signal, and as you can see, I have things well under control here. There are no humans on this planet. The signal you received must have been in error.</text>
		<text id="intro7">Again I must ask you to leave. If you disturb my planet, there will be consequences.</text>
		<text id="intro8">I received a warning… did something happen here…?</text>
		<text id="intro9">What… You… That…</text>
		<text id="intro10">I knew I could not trust humans! To think you would disturb this sanctuary when I explicitly warned you!</text>
		<text id="intro11">Very well, if you will not leave, then I have no choice but to make you a part of this nature preserve. </text>
		<text id="couch">It looks like there might be a survivor here after all... I should find out who this couch belongs to.</text>
		<text id="ranger1">If I had known my distress signal would result in this, I wouldn’t have sent it… I’m glad you came, though!</text>
		<text id="ranger2">I’ve been stuck here alone, unless you count that glitched [object=unnature.splicer], without any idea what’s happening to Earth… I was beginning to think humanity was wiped out!</text>
		<text id="ranger3">What’s happened to me? And who are you?</text>
		<text id="ranger4">Splicer messed with your DNA - she did the same thing to me back when she started malfunctioning. I was supposed to keep an eye on things here, but Splicer won’t accept any of my commands anymore.</text>
		<text id="ranger5">I don’t think the splicing is life-threatening, I’ve been like this for over a year. But the change is permanent unless you can talk some sense into Splicer. You may also feel weakened since your skills were reset.</text>
		<text id="ranger6">Let’s go, I have a hideout underground and we don’t want to risk [object=unnature.splicer] coming back and doing more harm…</text>
		<text id="ranger7">Well, come on! Don’t worry, I won’t bite!</text>
		<text id="ranger8">The first thing we need is to gather food… we can’t fight a mad AI on an empty stomach! It’s dangerous to stay too long on the surface with [object=unnature.splicer] around, but there’s not much to eat underground...</text>
		<text id="ranger9">I think [var=quest.werewolf_claws.meat_tree_seed] [item=meat_tree_seed]s should work well, and their bark will also help you sharpen your claws!</text>
		<text id="ranger10">What are these [item=meat_tree_seed]s? I don’t know, but they taste just like Chicken… who knows what strange things [object=unnature.splicer] did to their genes…</text>
		<text id="ranger11">But don’t worry, they aren’t poisonous. And if we have any leftover, you can plant them in the ground.</text>
		<text id="ranger12">That was a good start to [color=770000]Operation: Take Down Splicer[/color]! All that food made me drowsy, perhaps a short nap would be nice.</text>
		<text id="ranger13">Feel free to share my couch, just try not to cover it in too much fur!</text>
		<text id="ranger_intro1">So, Earth was destroyed… I had a feeling… Perhaps I was lucky to get stranded here, away from their eyes.</text>
		<text id="ranger_intro2">The Sanctuary Project was meant to be automated - while I was an engineer and biologist, my main duty was just to make sure [object=unnature.splicer] was operating normally and creating a stable ecosystem.</text>
		<text id="ranger_intro3">When the comms went dead, I thought it was a mechanical error and was too focused on fixing them and making contact with Earth to notice anything was off about Splicer.</text>
		<text id="ranger_intro4">Apparently it decided that this planet would be better off without humans, and didn’t appreciate my efforts to re-establish communications. So she turned me into a Werewolf and took control of the planet.</text>
		<text id="ranger_intro5">Since then, I’ve mostly just been trying to survive. It was all I could manage to get that distress signal off - you might have noticed that these paws aren’t meant for complex machinery.</text>
		<text id="ranger_intro6">Anyways, we should get some sleep. We have a long day ahead of us tomorrow if we want to overthrow Splicer!</text>
		<text id="body1">Now that you have strong, sharp [item=werewolf_claws], the next thing you need to do is train your body. You aren’t used to moving and fighting as a Werewolf, and it’s making you clumsy.</text>
		<text id="body2">I think fighting some [color=770000]Acid Raptors[/color] and [color=770000]Drill Beetles[/color] will help you get the hang of it.</text>
		<text id="body3">Won’t [object=unnature.splicer] get upset if I attack the wildlife here?</text>
		<text id="body4">Nah, when a human hurts an animal, it’s a terrible offense, but when an animal attacks another animal, it’s just a part of nature.</text>
		<text id="body5">She considers you an animal of the preserve now, so normal animal behaviors like hunting are acceptable.</text>
		<text id="body6">But…  that-</text>
		<text id="body7">That's Splicer for yeh.</text>
		<text id="body8">Excellent! I like those muscles! Looks like we’re ready to confront Splicer!</text>
		<text id="body9">Do you have a plan?</text>
		<text id="body10">Of course! Do you think I would have you running around on silly tasks with no plan in mind?</text>
		<text id="body11">…</text>
		<text id="body12">I appreciate the vote of confidence. In any case, my plan’s simple. Splicer has an emergency reset switch. I press that, and regain control of her and the planet.</text>
		<text id="body13">You just have to hit a switch? Then why did I need to do all that training…?</text>
		<text id="body14">Well… she has a bodyguard of sorts. I need you to keep the bodyguard busy while I sneak up and hit the switch.</text>
		<text id="body15">If you’re ready, I’ll show you the way to Splicer’s lab!</text>
		<text id="lets_go">Let's Go!</text>
		<text id="not_yet">Not Yet...</text>
		<text id="werewolf">Become Werewolf</text>
		<text id="human">Become Human</text>
		<text id="evolves">Evolves {item} on Werewolves.</text>
		<text id="only_werewolf">This DNA only works on Werewolves.</text>
		<text id="already_evolved">{item} is already evolved.</text>
		<text id="lab1">This area is for genetic technicians only, and is off limits to wildlife. Please return to your habitat.</text>
		<text id="leave">Leave</text>
		<text id="stay">Stay</text>
		<text id="lab2">I see. Perhaps my [color=770000]Chimera[/color] will change your mind?</text>
		<text id="lab3">You can do this - just keep it distracted until I hit the reset switch!</text>
		<text id="lab4">You are trying to reset me?!?! All I wanted was to create a paradise where animals could defend themselves and live free from humans…</text>
		<text id="lab5">An [color=770000]Unnature Sanctuary[/color]! But of course you have to come and try to ruin it. Whatever shape you come in, humans are still humans!</text>
		<text id="lab6">Go, [color=770000]Chimera[/color], and show them the power of Nature!</text>
		<text id="lab7">Aha! Reset successful! I’m surprised [object=unnature.splicer] didn’t try to splice us and turn us into rats… I guess she had confidence in her [color=770000]Chimera[/color].</text>
		<text id="lab8">Aha! Reset successful! [object=unnature.splicer] is now completely harmless!</text>
		<text id="lab9">Okay… mostly harmless!</text>
		<text id="lab10">Let’s return to the hideout. Now that Splicer’s reset, she should accept my commands.</text>
		<text id="victory1">[object=unnature.splicer] is now set up to change your DNA. Talk to her if you want to return to being human.</text>
		<text id="victory2">What about you?</text>
		<text id="victory3">After being a Werewolf for over a year, I feel pretty comfortable in this body. It’d feel weird to return to being human now.</text>
		<text id="victory4">Although, now that [object=unnature.splicer]’s under control, I might make a few adjustments every now and then!</text>
		<text id="research1">You know, I was a bit of a scientist myself before I got turned into a Werewolf. I bet I could help out on the [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color]!</text>
		<text id="research2">Bring it closer and I will board it!</text>
		<text id="research3">It’ll be good working together again - I think we make a good team!</text>
		<text id="distress_orbit">There's a distress signal from the surface of the planet... I wonder if any survivors made it here?</text>
		<text id="com_station">Interesting - there weren't meant to be any humans on this planet, but if there's a distress signal, perhaps some survivors crash landed there?</text>
		<text id="dice1">Hello there! I'm happy you found me!</text>
		<text id="dice2">You see, I don't get many visitors here, in the middle of these dark and dangerous tunnels.</text>
		<text id="dice3">I do so hope you'll stay for dinner, you look quite tasty, and it's been a while since I really had to flex my muscles!</text>

	<section id="depths">
		<text id="intro1">Hello! Isn’t this the perfect planet? A beautiful island, deep oceans, and mysterious ruins to explore!</text>
		<text id="intro2">Wow, I’m happy to hear that there are other survivors, and that you are searching for them. I'd tag along, but I still have too much left to discover here.</text>
		<text id="intro3">Are you okay here?</text>
		<text id="intro4">Definitely! But if you’re offering to help, there is something you could do.</text>
		<text id="intro5">See, I’m trying to explore more of the sea floor, but I can’t dive deep enough. If you could help me gather materials on this planet, I could build a [object=submersible].</text>
		<text id="sub1">Thanks for the help! We can now build the [object=submersible] at the [color=770000]Sub Pen[/color]!</text>
		<text id="sub2">The [object=submersible] is finished! We can use it to explore the deepest trenches. I have a feeling we’ll find more [color=770000]Monoliths[/color] there.</text>
		<text id="explorer1">Have you seen the ruins and [color=770000]Monolith[/color] on this island? I wonder what they are? And how to activate them?</text>
		<text id="explorer2">Aaah, it is so beautiful. I could stay here forever.</text>
		<text id="explorer3">I wonder who built the [color=770000]Monoliths[/color]? And what we need to activate them. The answer must be somewhere underwater!</text>
		<text id="monolith1">I’ve figured it out - we need [item=bone_shard]s to activate the [color=770000]Monoliths[/color]! We must activate them all - nothing is more important!</text>
		<text id="monolith2">We must activate all the [color=770000]Monoliths[/color]! There are {count} remaining that need to be activated!</text>
		<text id="power_core">I can craft [item=power_core]s from [item=power_core_parts] for the [object=submersible]!</text>
		<text id="wizard1">I must thank you. I was stuck here a long, long time, and this puppet was insufficient for my needs. I could never have come this far without you.</text>
		<text id="wizard2">Stuck here? Puppet? What are you talking about? Who - are you?</text>
		<text id="wizard3">Forgive me, I haven’t introduced myself.</text>
		<text id="wizard4">They called me the Dishonored One.</text>
		<text id="wizard5">They thought they knew everything. But in the end, who prevailed? I have survived, and thus, I have won!</text>
		<text id="wizard6">I hope they enjoy their lofty ideals as they rot in their graves. Prepare to join them!</text>
		<text id="summon_wizard">You thought you could escape that easily?!</text>
		<text id="control_wizard">Everything is perfectly fine. Accept your fate and let us destroy you.</text>
		<text id="end1">Don’t attack - I’m not your enemy!</text>
		<text id="end2">Who are you?</text>
		<text id="end3">I’m the sister of the Dishonored One. He kept me alive because of our shared blood, but there was no love between us. I was a Teacher… and he - he destroyed us all.</text>
		<text id="end4">Maybe if we had dealt with him differently, none of this would have happened… but at least he is defeated now and the threat is over.</text>
		<text id="end5">Here, take this [item=dragon_armor2] as my thanks. Hopefully you will use our magic better than they did. Perhaps my brother wasn’t entirely crazy when he refused to share our teachings.</text>
		<text id="end6">The stasis spell my brother used to keep us alive was complex, but it is not impossible that others were able to cast it as well. Perhaps I’m not the last of my kind after all.</text>
		<text id="end7">Thank you for all your help. I am off to search for any survivors - even if it takes my whole life, I would rather believe others still live than stay here in despair.</text>
		<text id="end8">Huh? What was I doing here…? I remember coming here and that there was something important I had to do here. But it’s all so fuzzy.</text>
		<text id="unnature">After being possessed by an insane alien, you can't expect me to go out there and get mutated by an insane robot.</text>
		<text id="research1">How about leaving this planet behind? You’re welcome to join me in the [color=770000]Mobile Research Lab[/color]!</text>
		<text id="research2">Yeah… perhaps that’s for the best. Maybe I can get my life back in order and even help you with your research!</text>
		<text id="research3">It’s hard to believe that humanity was almost wiped out - the last year still feels like a dream to me. But, I’ll do everything I can to help!</text>
		<text id="tablet1">No profession was more honored than the Teachers. The Teachers used their skills to travel the universe in an instant, spreading their knowledge to the distant stars.</text>
		<text id="tablet2">It was the way of the Teachers to share their discoveries to the benefit of all. But, one Teacher refused, instead hoarding all of their secrets and looking down on the rest.</text>
		<text id="tablet3">Ever tolerant, it took a long time for the other Teachers to act. But eventually, they cast him out of their ranks and named him the Dishonored One.</text>
		<text id="tablet4">The Dishonored One sneered at the other Teachers, calling them fools and assuring them that he would have the last laugh. After this, he disappeared. Only his sister knew where he had hidden himself.</text>
		<text id="tablet5">With many years of peace, none expected the flood. The waters rose and rose, flooding villages and killing many. Even the teachers couldn't handle the unrelenting waters.</text>
		<text id="tablet6">When the Dishonored One announced that he had conjured the flood, he did not seem the least bit remorseful, even as the death toll rose and rose.</text>
		<text id="tablet7">The Teachers knew they had to stop the Dishonored One. They banded together and fought him at the summit of the tallest mountain, where the waters had not yet reached.</text>
		<text id="tablet8">The battle raged for weeks, and drained even this planet’s vast amount of magic. With the supply of magic running thin, survival became a challenge.</text>
		<text id="tablet9">The Dishonored One survived by going into a deep slumber, and the Teachers deactivated the Mana Conveyors so that even when magic returned to this world, the Dishonored One would be unable to awaken.</text>
		<text id="tablet10">This is the final warning of those who lived on this planet: do not awaken the Dishonored One. Let him rest for all eternity.</text>
