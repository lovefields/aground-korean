		<text id="introduce2">Hmph. I guess with [var=quest.storehouse.wood] [item=wood] and [var=quest.storehouse.berries] [item=berries] I might be able to make a decent [color=770000]Storehouse[/color].</text>
		<text id="accept1">Alright! I can find that, no problem.</text>
		<text id="accept2">Take this [item=stone_axe], if you’re so gung-ho.</text>
		<text id="stamina">I'm exhausted. You look tired too. We should rest in the [color=770000]Hut[/color] to save the game and restore our [tile=stamina] [color=006600]Stamina[/color].</text>
		<text id="wood">How's my old [item=stone_axe]? I bet it could chop down a tree by hitting [key=attack] next to one.</text>
		<text id="hint1">All items go into your inventory when you collect them. You can check it by hitting [key=inventory].</text>
		<text id="hint2">If your [tile=stamina] [color=006600]Stamina[/color] runs out, you will lose [tile=health] [color=770000]Health[/color], and if your [tile=health] [color=770000]Health[/color] runs out, you will die.</text>
		<text id="hint3">That's why you need to eat a lot of [item=berries], [item=fruit] and [item=meat]. You can do this by selecting them in your inventory.</text>
		<text id="storehouse1">You gathered everything already? I’m impressed.</text>
		<text id="storehouse2">Let’s get this [color=770000]Storehouse[/color] built!</text>
		<text id="storehouse3">Look at that! Don’t you feel accomplished?</text>
		<text id="storehouse4">Yeah… actually, this will be useful. Now we can avoid getting tired from carrying too much.</text>
		<text id="storehouse5">We can quickly drop off all that extra weight by using the Move All buttons, and use [key=quest] to toggle starred items - starred items will stay in your inventory when you hit Move All.</text>
		<text id="farmer">We should make a deal with the [object=farmer], I bet he could help us grow some tasty food.</text>
		<text id="miner">Did you see that [object=miner] emerge from underground? You should see what she wants.</text>
		<text id="kitchen1">What do you think of building a [color=770000]Kitchen[/color]? [item=meat] is good, but it’s even better cooked.</text>
		<text id="kitchen2">I'll need [var=quest.kitchen.wood] [item=wood] and [var=quest.kitchen.coal] [item=coal] to build the [color=770000]Kitchen[/color].</text>
		<text id="kitchen3">Looks like you have everything I need. Let's get this [color=770000]Kitchen[/color] built!</text>
		<text id="kitchen4">You can cook food at the [color=770000]Kitchen[/color] as long as you have [item=wood] or [item=coal] to fuel it.</text>
		<text id="kitchen5">You know what I’m craving? Some [item=cheese]. Nothing is quite as delicious.</text>
		<text id="kitchen6">I could upgrade the [color=770000]Kitchen[/color] to make [item=cheese] and cook new recipes for [var=quest.kitchen2.wood] [item=wood] and [var=quest.kitchen2.steel_bar] [item=steel_bar]s.</text>
		<text id="no_kitchen">What happened to my beautiful [color=770000]Kitchen[/color]? You better build a new one ASAP! You can build it using a [item=kitchen_blueprint].</text>
		<text id="kitchen7">Looks like you have everything I need. Let's get this [color=770000]Kitchen[/color] upgraded!</text>
		<text id="kitchen8">Try out some of the new recipes! It almost feels civilized!</text>
		<text id="farm">Man, I'm hungry. I hope you get that [color=770000]Farm[/color] finished soon!</text>

		<text id="introduce1">Boy am I glad to see you. Here I was thinkin’ I was all alone, just one old man in an empty world.</text>
		<text id="introduce2">I still got some life in these old bones and I reckon I could help you out. Farming’s my trade, and we all need some good food to keep us going.</text>
		<text id="introduce3">How about we build a barn and get a [color=770000]Farm[/color] up and runnin’?</text>
		<text id="farm1">Nice! I'll put up the barn and plant some [item=wheat_seed]!</text>
		<text id="farm2">Now we have a [color=770000]Farm[/color]! Stop by on occasion to pick up growin' crops - they will help restore your [tile=stamina] [color=006600]Stamina[/color]. Here - take some [item=bread] to keep you going while it grows.</text>
		<text id="farm3">You can get [item=wood] by chopping down trees.</text>
		<text id="farm4">If you want to grow more, simply plant more seeds! You can also manage and remove existing crops at the barn!</text>
		<text id="farm5">Look at our awesome [color=770000]Farm[/color]! It's as good as anything I used to grow back home! But if you want to grow more, I can always make more seeds.</text>
		<text id="kitchen">Raw [item=wheat] isn’t very tasty, but I bet we could make something better if you and the [object=builder] made a [color=770000]Kitchen[/color].</text>
		<text id="pen1">You know what this [color=770000]Farm[/color] needs? Some Livestock! How about capturing some [color=770000][tile=boar] Boars[/color] with a [item=net]?</text>
		<text id="pen2">I’ll add a [color=770000]Pen[/color] for [var=quest.pen.pig] [item=pig]s and [var=quest.pen.wood] [item=wood].</text>
		<text id="pen3">Now aren't those the fattest and juiciest looking [item=pig]s you've ever seen?</text>
		<text id="pen4">With the pen, we can now produce [item=meat] and [item=milk]!</text>
		<text id="pen5">If you want to build more [color=770000]Pen[/color]s, use the [item=pen_blueprint].</text>
		<text id="pig">How do you get a [item=pig]? Lay a [item=net] on the ground and then lure a wounded [color=770000][tile=boar] Boar[/color] onto it, and if you're lucky, it’ll be caught and domesticated!</text>
		<text id="kitchen2">Milking a [item=pig]? Why not? This is a strange land. But what we could really use is some [item=cheese] - talk to the [object=builder] about improving the [color=770000]Kitchen[/color].</text>
		<text id="halloween">I hope you don't mind, but I did a little decoratin' for the Harvest Festival! We could use a little celebrating around here. I also put some [item=jakolantern]s in the [color=770000]Storehouse[/color].</text>
		<text id="add_sugar">This farm is getting pretty big! To celebrate I found some [item=sugar_seed]! Try planting a field of [item=sugar]!</text>
		<text id="add_cotton">I met a few traders by the [color=770000]Dock[/color] and got some [item=cotton_seed]!</text>
		<text id="orchard1">There are a lot of [item=fruit] around here. With enough seeds, I could probably plant a nice [color=770000]Orchard[/color]!</text>
		<text id="orchard2">Great, with this many [item=fruit] we have enough [item=orchard_seed] to plant an [color=770000]Orchard[/color]!</text>
		<text id="orchard3">Let me know when you have enough [item=fruit] for the [color=770000]Orchard[/color]!</text>
		<text id="orchard4">Seeds can be planted on grass tiles as long as there is enough empty space to place them. Let me know where you want to plant the [item=orchard_seed]!</text>
		<text id="orchard5">You can also use seeds to change crops in the [color=770000]Barn[/color]. If you want to make new seeds, just let me know!</text>
		<text id="snowman">The first snowfall is here! That makes it as good a time as any to celebrate! I even made a magic [item=snowman] from [item=ice_berries], I hope you like it!</text>
		<text id="sign1">This place is starting to feel like home, ain't it? How about giving the place a name?</text>

		<text id="introduce1">Oh, hey. Didn’t realize there were other survivors.</text>

		<text id="smelter">How's the digging going? Maybe we should build a [color=770000]Smelter[/color] to melt down ores into bars.</text>
		<text id="accept1">Great! Let me know when you have enough [item=coal]!</text>
		<text id="smelter1">This is the stuff. I should have a [color=770000]Smelter[/color] up in no time!</text>
		<text id="smelter2">The [color=770000]Smelter[/color] can turn raw ores into bars. It requires fuel to melt them down, but luckily there is plenty of [item=coal] around to keep it running.</text>
		<text id="hint1">Well, what are you waiting for? Just hold [key=down] to dig down and find those ores!</text>
		<text id="hint2">Ore is heavy - make sure to drop them off in the [color=770000]Storehouse[/color] between trips.</text>
		<text id="hint3">It’s easy to get caught up mining, but make sure you have enough [tile=stamina] [color=006600]Stamina[/color] for the return trip.</text>
		<text id="hint4">The deeper underground you go, the better ores you will find.</text>
		<text id="hint5">If you plan on mining deep underground, make sure to bring [item=torch]es with you. They'll provide light when equipped, but will eventually burn out.</text>
		<text id="hint6">I can make [item=torch]es if you need some.</text>
		<text id="workshop1">How about a [color=770000]Workshop[/color] to turn those metal bars into tools? I can make one for [var=quest.workshop.iron_bar] [item=iron_bar]s and [var=quest.workshop.wood] [item=wood].</text>
		<text id="workshop2">Alright, let's get this [color=770000]Workshop[/color] set up!</text>
		<text id="workshop3">At the [color=770000]Workshop[/color], you can instantly create any tools or items that you have the ingredients to make.</text>

		<text id="torch">[item=iron] is pretty deep underground, so take a [item=torch] to help you see. If this one burns out, talk to me and I can make more.</text>
		<text id="smelter3">Once you have enough [item=iron], select [item=iron_bar] from the [color=770000]Smelter[/color] menu, and it will automatically smelt as long as there is fuel remaining.</text>
		<text id="smelter4">You can add as many jobs to the [color=770000]Smelter[/color] as you have ingredients for, and it will smelt them one by one while you are away as long as it has fuel.</text>
		<text id="pick">If you want to mine through [color=770000][tile=stone] Stone[/color] to reach [item=gold], you'll need to craft an [item=iron_pickaxe] or a [item=steel_pickaxe] at the [color=770000]Workshop[/color].</text>
		<text id="equip1">If you want to mine through [color=770000][tile=stone] Stone[/color] to reach [item=gold], you'll need to equip an [item=iron_pickaxe] or a [item=steel_pickaxe]. Hit [key=equipment] to manage your equipment.</text>

		<text id="introduce2">I might have borrowed a few things. But, listen. I’ll repay you by offering my services. I have connections with many traders on other islands.</text>
		<text id="introduce3">Traders? There are more survivors out there?</text>
		<text id="introduce4">Yup. But I’ll need [var=quest.market.gold_bar] [item=gold_bar]s to convince them to come here.</text>
		<text id="introduce5">You’re going to charge us when you were just caught stealing?!</text>
		<text id="introduce6">That was that. This is business. My offer is [var=quest.market.gold_bar] [item=gold_bar]s to add this island to the trade route.</text>
		<text id="introduce7">Fine. If there are other survivors out there, trading with them could get us off this island.</text>

		<text id="market1">Perfect! I feel this is the beginning of many lucrative trades between us.</text>
		<text id="market2">Take this [item=coin_purse]. You’ll need it to store coins for buying and selling. I recommend buying a [item=mega_backpack] as soon as you can, they are a real life-saver!</text>
		<text id="market3">At the [color=770000]Market[/color], you can sell goods to get coins, which you can use to buy other goods.</text>
		<text id="market4">The [color=770000]Market[/color] sometimes gets new stock too, so if you can't get what you want or they run out of inventory, check back later.</text>
		<text id="market5">To make a [item=gold_bar], you'll need to smelt [item=gold], which is found deep underground. The [object=miner] may have some tips for mining that deep.</text>

		<text id="lab1">I knew it! This is the secret! I must set up a laboratory immediately!</text>
		<text id="lab2">Your reward? Bring materials to my lab and I will mix up a magic potion for you.</text>
		<text id="lab3">Hurry up! My research is at a standstill until I get some [item=dragonblood]!</text>
		<text id="pen1">I need more [item=dragonblood]! Bring me [var=quest.wyrm_pen.wyrm] live [item=wyrm]s and we'll have an endless supply of [item=dragonblood] to experiment with!</text>
		<text id="pen2">Excellent! Stand back while I work my magic!</text>
		<text id="pen3">Behold my brilliant invention - the [color=770000]Wyrm Pen[/color]! It's more than just a pen, it's an endless supply of [item=dragonblood]!</text>
		<text id="wyrm">I bet you could capture a [item=wyrm] with a [item=net] if it was heavily wounded. But you must catch it alive!</text>
		<text id="dragon1">We must experiment more on the [item=wyrm]s! What do they eat? Why do they give [item=dragonblood]? You must feed the [item=wyrm]s in the [color=770000]Wyrm Pen[/color] to find out more about their evolution!</text>
		<text id="dragon2">I knew it! The [item=wyrm]s metamorphosize into [item=dragon]s! But then why are there so few [item=adult_dragon]s in this land?</text>
		<text id="dragon3">I believe there is a dragon lair somewhere in the mountain. If you find it, summon me... perhaps some of these secrets can be discovered there.</text>
		<text id="dragon4">Ah, an [item=adult_dragon]! Let's see what she has to say - I can translate for you with a simple spell.</text>
		<text id="dragon5">Who are you, to awaken me from my slumber?</text>
		<text id="dragon6">I am a seeker of truth and magic. Tell me - why are there so few dragons left in this world?</text>
		<text id="dragon7">Because the old ones left. They too were seekers of truth and magic. And they betrayed my kind.</text>
		<text id="dragon8">Then perhaps we can help you! All we ask for in return is knowledge.</text>
		<text id="dragon9">You think you can help? Then prove it. If you can hatch and bring me [var=quest.hatch_dragons.dragon] [item=dragon]s, then we will talk. Otherwise, begone!</text>
		<text id="dragon10">I knew you would betray me! Taste my wrath!</text>
		<text id="dragon11">I don't think we should wake her again until we have the [item=dragon]s.</text>
		<text id="dragon12">You have done it? Perhaps there is yet hope for my race.</text>
		<text id="dragon12_a">Excellent! So, you'll tell us the secrets of magic?</text>
		<text id="dragon13">Unfortunately, I do not know the secrets you seek. The old ones created us, and they built this lair to raise us.</text>
		<text id="dragon14">However, answers may lie on the islands to the east. Return to this lair when you are ready, and I will fly you there.</text>
		<text id="dragon15">Another dragon lair! Imagine how many dragons were once raised in lairs like these with magic! I wonder why... in any case, allow me to activate this lair.</text>
		<text id="dragon16">I also built a [color=770000]Wyrm Pen[/color] here, in case we need to raise more dragons! But don't expect me to harvest [item=dragonblood] here, I've got more important things to research.</text>
		<text id="call_dragon">Where did you leave the dragon? I'll call it over here - try not to lose track of it.</text>
		<text id="lair1">I knew it! This lair is artificial, made by magic! It looks like its purpose was to raise dragons!</text>
		<text id="lair2">I bet I can activate it...</text>
		<text id="lair3">Aha! Done! With this lair, we can raise our own dragons. The lair seems to point east, perhaps we could fly a dragon that direction and discover more...</text>
		<text id="axe1">Let me see that [item=rusty_axe]... It's tough to spot with all the rust, but I recognize those symbols!</text>
		<text id="axe2">There is some ancient magic here, but it is worn out. If you bring me the right magical ingredient, perhaps I can repair it...</text>
		<text id="axe3">That [item=fire_tusk]... what kind of creature did you get it from? It seems to resonate with the [item=rusty_axe], perhaps that is the magical ingredient we were looking for!</text>
		<text id="axe4">I have done it! I wonder who made this [item=thunder_axe], and how old it is? If you want to make more, I added the recipe to the laboratory.</text>
		<text id="shadow_cape1">Let me see that [item=dark_fur]! It appears to exist between the world of the spirits and the world of the living...</text>
		<text id="shadow_cape2">I'll have to research it further, but I can easily turn it into a [item=shadow_cape] that will hide you from normal eyes. I added the recipe to the laboratory.</text>
		<text id="magic_intro1">This island is overflowing with magic - we are definitely in the right place!</text>
		<text id="magic_intro2">I’ve seen this kind of magic before. These structures are partially organic and are all hibernating. They’ll need to be awoken.</text>
		<text id="magic_intro3">I already know how to activate this purple chamber, but the other structures will require more study.</text>
		<text id="magic_intro4">This should be a good base of operations. I'll set up some supplies.</text>
		<text id="wyrm1">Clues for activating the other structures might lie with the [item=wyrm]s.</text>
		<text id="wyrm2">You should follow one on this island and learn their secrets, while I translate some of these markings.</text>
		<text id="wyrm3">Don't worry - you've dealt with [item=wyrm]s before. Following one to its den should be no problem!</text>
		<text id="wyrm4">What's that? There was a Wyrm Queen? That's irrelevant, look at the [item=spirit_gem] you found! I'm certain this is what we need to make a breakthrough!</text>
		<text id="wyrm5">Here, try these [item=goggles]. The markings helped me invent them, and while they didn't help me see the secret behind these structures, they may help you see what we are missing.</text>
		<text id="wyrm6">You should follow the [item=wyrm]s on the eastern island, not here! I've already studied the [item=wyrm]s here!</text>
		<text id="sleep">I need more time to study this. Why don't you rest in the purple chamber?</text>
		<text id="forest">That forest to the east feels dangerous. I set up a [item=fence], and I recommend you don't go beyond it.</text>
		<text id="elementals1">I have determined that a [item=spirit_gem] can capture a spirit of fire or water, resulting in a [item=fire_gem] or [item=water_gem]. The infused gems should allow us to activate the structures.</text>
		<text id="elementals2">Having trouble finding elemental spirits? They are invisible to the naked eye, but my [item=goggles] should reveal them!</text>
		<text id="elementals3">You can place [item=spirit_gem]s like traps, then capture spirits by luring them onto them!</text>
		<text id="spirit_gem">Now all the structures are activated! I think we deserve a break in the purple chamber before we continue our research!</text>
		<text id="magic_farm1">What are you waiting for? Use the [item=water_gem] at the blue structure to activate it!</text>
		<text id="magic_farm2">The blue structure is a magical synthesizer! It can create items from magic!</text>
		<text id="magic_farm3">Use [item=focus_gem]s to power the synthesizer.</text>
		<text id="magic_farm4">We still need a [item=water_gem] to power the blue structure! Use a [item=spirit_gem] to capture a water elemental!</text>
		<text id="magic_forge1">What are you waiting for? Use the [item=fire_gem] at the red structure to activate it!</text>
		<text id="magic_forge2">The red structure is some sort of ancient magical forge. It can enchant items!</text>
		<text id="magic_forge3">Try experimenting with different combinations of items and magical ingredients at the Forge - you may stumble upon something brilliant!</text>
		<text id="magic_forge4">We still need a [item=fire_gem] to power the red structure! Use a [item=spirit_gem] to capture a fire elemental!</text>
		<text id="alter_gem1">I’ve been in deep contemplation, trying to decode the secrets of the [item=wyrm]s.</text>
		<text id="alter_gem2">If you bring me [var=quest.alter_gem.wyrm] [item=wyrm], [var=quest.alter_gem.fire_tusk] [item=fire_tusk] and [var=quest.alter_gem.yeti_fur] [item=yeti_fur], I will be able to finish my research.</text>
		<text id="alter_gem3">I have done it! I have created an [item=alter_gem]! This will allow us to transform [item=wyrm]s - and probably other creatures - into usable equipment!</text>
		<text id="alter_gem4">We must continue to explore this branch of magic! Take this [item=alter_gem] and use it on a [item=wyrm] yourself! If you need more [item=alter_gem]s, I have added the recipe to the synthesizer.</text>
		<text id="alter_gem5">To use the [item=alter_gem], select it in your inventory, choose Transform, and choose a creature to transform.</text>
		<text id="alter_gem6">Don’t be afraid to try [item=alter_gem]s with other creatures… like a [item=dragon]. Or, dare I suggest it - an [item=adult_dragon]?!</text>
		<text id="alter_gem7">Running out of [item=alter_gem]s? You can find them deep underground or create them at the synthesizer.</text>
		<text id="alter_gem8">Make sure you use [item=alter_gem]s on well-fed creatures. Hungry creatures won't stay transformed long!</text>
		<text id="first1">You didn’t crash with the rest of us?</text>
		<text id="first2">No, I was part of a scouting mission for the colonization program.</text>
		<text id="first3">We were four. But, the other three died, and when they came soon after, I knew this planet was cursed.</text>

		<text id="first5">They were here?! After you?</text>
		<text id="first6">Yes. I believe they were jealous of my magic. Or frightened of it? It’s hard to say for sure...</text>
		<text id="second1">You met them on this planet ten years ago? That's before they tried to wipe out humanity and destroy Earth!</text>
		<text id="second2">Correct. I was the first to encounter them, and the first they tried to kill.</text>
		<text id="second3">I don't know what I could've done differently to stop the war. They arrived suddenly with their biological weapons and attacked without a word.</text>
		<text id="second4">If only there was a way to communicate with them...</text>
		<text id="second5">We probably could communicate with them now, using my magic translation.</text>
		<text id="second6">But, hopefully we'll never encounter them again, now that they seem content to ignore us.</text>
		<text id="oldone1">I’ve been noticing some very strange spikes in the magical energy lately. It could be nothing, but it could be one of them.</text>

		<text id="oldone6">That magical exoskeleton looks vaguely familiar... are you one of them?</text>
		<text id="oldone7">The ones you call "them" are my foolish brethren. Long ago, they chose to abandon their homeworld, while I stayed and took a path of isolation and immortality.</text>
		<text id="oldone8">Can you tell us about your magic? What are these magical energy spikes? Why did you create and raise the dragons?</text>
		<text id="oldone9">Silence! We do not speak of these things with the likes of you! I have been very tolerant. Otherwise you would have been dead long ago.</text>
		<text id="oldone10">But now I see that they were right about one thing. The universe would be better off without you and your kind!</text>
		<text id="oldone11">You will regret choosing to disturb me!</text>
		<text id="oldone12">No!</text>
		<text id="oldone13">What’s wrong, didn’t we win?</text>
		<text id="oldone14">We were too slow! It sent out a signal. They will know we are on this planet!</text>
		<text id="oldone15">We must learn all the magic we can - and use their power against them when they come! Otherwise we are all doomed.</text>
		<text id="oldone16">You are more adept at magic than I expected! This cannot be allowed, only we should wield magic.</text>
		<text id="oldone17">It's sending a signal! If they hear it, they will come! I must finish this quickly!</text>
		<text id="oldone18">What happened? Are you ok?</text>
		<text id="oldone19">No…[pause=4] The signal was sent…[pause=4] And my life-force has been completely drained…</text>

		<text id="oldone_tips1">[tile=alchemist anim=alchemist.idle] I'll set up a defensive barrier and healing magic. Stay behind me while it attacks, and then hit it when it overloads.</text>

		<text id="tent1">I shouldn't rest in some random person's tent!</text>
		<text id="tent2">This must be the [object=hunter]'s tent. I should leave it alone.</text>
		<text id="intro1">Hey, you! Did you see me take down that boar?</text>
		<text id="intro2">Yeah, how… how did you do that?</text>
		<text id="intro3">Simple! A bit of proper technique is all you need.</text>
		<text id="intro4">I’m trying to clear out this area. If you help me out I could teach you how to hunt.</text>
		<text id="accept1">You need to employ the element of surprise. Hit enemies from behind, and you’ll get a critical hit.</text>
		<text id="accept2">Here, have a [item=workbench] - you can use it in your inventory to make weapons of your own!</text>
		<text id="accept3">I prefer [item=bow]s so I don't have to get close to enemies, but if you want to use melee weapons, a [item=buckler] will help you block attacks!</text>
		<text id="accept4">Use [key=equipment] to equip a weapon, [key=attack] to attack with the equipped weapon, and [key=defend] to block with a shield.</text>
		<text id="accept5">Why don't you craft a [item=bow] and kill some [color=770000][tile=boar] Boars[/color]. And let me know if you need any hunting tips!</text>
		<text id="reject1">You seem dangerous. Stay out of our area!</text>
		<text id="reject2">Well, fine! I’ll just go back to the mountains then!</text>
		<text id="reject3">Ready to learn some hunting techniques?</text>
		<text id="hunt1">We’ll have this area cleared of dangerous creatures in no time!</text>
		<text id="hunt2">For a job well done, let me give you my old [item=backpack] - it might come in handy when you’re out in the field.</text>
		<text id="tip1">You could dig a tunnel to sneak up on boars and hit them from behind.</text>
		<text id="tip2">[item=red_berries] can be used to temporarily increase your attack power - but be careful, they’re not good for your health.</text>
		<text id="tip3">If you keep getting “blocked,” that enemy is too strong for you. You’ll need a better weapon or a stronger attack.</text>
		<text id="tip4">Setting [item=arrow]s to a hotkey lets you fire them as long as the [item=bow] is in your inventory, even if it's not equipped!</text>
		<text id="tent3">So there I was, shivering and alone on the dark mountainside, when I saw firelight! And heard laughter! It sounded so companionable...</text>
		<text id="tent4">So you came down to make friends with us?</text>
		<text id="tent5">Of course not. And I certainly wasn’t hunting boars to try and impress you. Not at all.</text>
		<text id="tent6">I simply wanted to expand my hunting range.</text>
		<text id="tent7">I’d like to know more about this place, and whether there’s anything beyond this island…</text>
		<text id="tent8">There’s other islands out there to the east. I’ve seen them, from high in the mountains.</text>
		<text id="tent9">Think we could get there?</text>
		<text id="tent10">Not sure. The coast on that end is treacherous. Plus, those islands looked plenty strange to me. Might be dangerous.</text>
		<text id="tent11">So you’re saying we should just be content with the way things are?</text>
		<text id="tent12">I’m saying that we don’t need to go borrowing trouble when life is already hard.</text>
		<text id="fence1">I’d like to keep the wildlife in check around here.</text>
		<text id="fence2">Could you use the [item=workbench] I gave you to make [var=quest.fence.fence] [item=fence]s? Then we could start setting up a perimeter.</text>
		<text id="fence3">Perfect. [color=770000][tile=boar] Boar[/color]s can't run through [item=fence]s, so we can use them to protect our settlement.</text>
		<text id="fence4">I'll place one here, place the other [item=fence]s around our base to protect it!</text>
		<text id="wolf1">I've noticed a wolf pup hanging around our settlement. He seems lonely.</text>
		<text id="wolf2">Doesn't he have a pack?</text>
		<text id="wolf3">They must have left him behind.</text>
		<text id="wolf4">With [var=quest.wolf.net] [item=net]s, [var=quest.wolf.trap] [item=trap]s and [var=quest.wolf.meat] [item=meat], we may be able to tame him.</text>
		<text id="wolf5">Okay, let’s see what we can do with this pup.</text>
		<text id="wolf6">Well done, he seems to trust you completely. You have a loyal companion now.</text>

		<text id="powerplant2">Thanks, now I can get this fixed up in no time.</text>
		<text id="powerplant3">Back in business! We can use [item=coal] or [item=refined_oil] to power the plant. You can also make a [item=battery] here.</text>
		<text id="powerplant4">Oh, and take this scrap metal from the repair as thanks for the [item=titanium]!</text>

		<text id="elevator2">Wouldn’t it be convenient to have a contraption to help you haul everything back to the surface?!</text>

		<text id="repair">Need anything repaired? I’m your gal!</text>

		<text id="intro1">There are more survivors here than I expected!</text>
		<text id="intro2">Yeah? But it's not enough. If we're to survive as a species we'll need to join up with other colonies.</text>
		<text id="intro3">You think they made it?</text>
		<text id="intro4">I'm sure they're out there. We just need a way to find and reach them.</text>
		<text id="intro5">And if we're attacked on the way?</text>
		<text id="intro6">Then at least we tried! I'm not going to sit here clammed up on this planet just because it feels safe for the moment.</text>
		<text id="mirrows1">Hey, what’s wrong? You look down.</text>
		<text id="mirrows2">I tried asking the Mirrows to stop harassing everyone, but they won’t listen and I don't want to fight them.</text>
		<text id="mirrows3">Good of you to try. But they’re stubborn as mules, and don't listen to anything except strength.</text>
		<text id="mirrows4">I’m not giving up yet. It’s not fair that they can abuse their power like this.</text>
		<text id="mirrows5">Maybe try to learn as much as you can about the Mirrows. Have you checked out all the areas around their lab?</text>
		<text id="mirrows6">Are you the “C” in the Mirrows’ lab notes? Were you working with them?</text>
		<text id="mirrows7">No… not exactly. They’re - [pause=4]They’re my parents.</text>
		<text id="mirrows8">Your parents!? If you’re their daughter, maybe they’d listen to you. Will you try negotiating with them?</text>
		<text id="mirrows9">Believe me, I’ve tried. They won’t listen to reason. They’re too focused on their “enhancements” and won’t even consider other solutions to our problems.</text>
		<text id="mirrows10">We’d need something really powerful to get them to change directions. Something that can't be explained with science.</text>
		<text id="mirrows11">What do you think about this [item=dragon_armor]? It has the power of an [item=adult_dragon], but can be worn like armor!</text>
		<text id="mirrows12">That's so weird, but I definitely think it's worth a shot. Let's show it to my parents.</text>
		<text id="mirrows13">Back again? This time we'll turn you into a cyborg for sure!</text>
		<text id="mirrows14">Wait! Don't attack, it's me.</text>
		<text id="mirrows15">Cass? What are you doing here?</text>
		<text id="mirrows16">I want you to take a look at this. Maybe you don’t have to turn people into cyborgs after all.</text>
		<text id="mirrows17">What is this thing? Its power readings are off the charts, but it doesn’t appear man made at all!</text>
		<text id="mirrows18">If I tell you, will you agree to stop your human experimentation and extortion?</text>
		<text id="mirrows19">Of course, this could be a whole new line of research for us!</text>
		<text id="mirrows20">It turns out the species who originally inhabited this planet created the dragons and magical equipment. And, that species may have been - them.</text>

		<text id="nav5">But they're gone now?</text>
		<text id="nav6">We haven't detected them on this planet, but even if they did leave, they are sure to return eventually.</text>
		<text id="nav7">This is why we were willing to sacrifice everything for strength... from the day we landed on this planet, a confrontation with them became inevitable.</text>

		<text id="first1">Not bad at all... I wonder who began building this structure... and why they stopped. It looks pretty recent...</text>
		<text id="first2">Help…[pause=4] please…[pause=4] shelter…</text>
		<text id="first3">Someone is outside! Can I trust them?</text>
		<text id="first4">Thank you. I owe you my life. I had all but given up hope - I was too tired and hungry to finish this shelter. But what do we do now?</text>
		<text id="first5">For now, we stay warm and dry.</text>
		<text id="first6">But what about after that? How will we survive on this deserted island?</text>
		<text id="first7">Is there even any point? We’re stuck here, there’s no going back.</text>
		<text id="first8">At least we can try. Maybe life here won’t be as bad as you think it will.</text>
		<text id="first9">Please…[pause=4] help…</text>
		<text id="second1">… so when I arrived here I just started digging and didn’t even realize there was a storm.</text>
		<text id="second2">But I’m glad you’re here. I was getting tired of eating dirt, and there’s nothing like a warm fire after a long day underground.</text>
		<text id="second3">Do you think there are more survivors out there?</text>
		<text id="second4">Honestly, I’m surprised anyone survived that crash. But here we are, so maybe others survived too?</text>
		<text id="third1">Now I bet you youngin’s are thinking this here’s the end of the world, but I thought the same during World War 3 and yet here we all are.</text>
		<text id="third2">The way I sees it, we just got to make the best of the situation, and be glad there’s food to eat and company to share.</text>
		<text id="third3">But how long will we have to live on this god-forsaken island?</text>
		<text id="third4">Who knows? But as long as there’s life, there’s hope. Perhaps in time this island will be as good as home.</text>
		<text id="fourth1">So tell us what you know of other survivors?</text>
		<text id="fourth2">Most of us were scattered across different islands, but some of the islands have more survivors and even some working technology.</text>
		<text id="fourth3">I’ve even heard rumors of an island with a nearly intact ship.</text>
		<text id="fourth4">Could it still fly?</text>
		<text id="fourth5">As I said, all I’ve heard are rumors. But even if it could, it’d be certain death. Best to stay on this planet, they don’t seem to care about us here.</text>
		<text id="hunter1">You're so good at this stuff. Were you a hunter before the crash?</text>
		<text id="hunter2">Heh. Never killed an animal in my life before this. I was a scientist. Lab work. Molecules.</text>
		<text id="hunter3">Wow. How'd you figure it all out then?</text>
		<text id="hunter4">It's amazing what you can do when you need to survive.</text>
		<text id="hunter5">You change. You become someone your old self would barely recognize.</text>
		<text id="mirrows1">They’ve been rebuilding technology?</text>
		<text id="mirrows2">Yeah, Sunset Haven has power and industrial equipment.</text>
		<text id="mirrows3">But the folks there aren’t too happy with the Mirrows who set it all up.</text>
		<text id="mirrows4">The Mirrows survived!?</text>
		<text id="mirrows5">You know them?</text>
		<text id="mirrows6">Unfortunately. We were part of the same research group back home, studying genetics.</text>
		<text id="mirrows7">After the attack, they started doing awful stuff like human experimentation. I could no longer work with them.</text>
		<text id="mirrows8">Hey, we should rebuild some technology here, too! If they can do it, why not us?</text>
		<text id="mirrows9">That's the spirit! This place will feel just like home in no time.</text>

		<text id="panel1">3/15 - We have been left with no choice but to abandon Earth. Our weapons cannot hurt them, and they pursue us with a vengeance. Perhaps, on another planet, we can finally evade their wrath.</text>
		<text id="panel13">5/1 - The ship was heavily damaged in the escape, but the jump drive activated successfully. That should keep us ahead of pursuers, assuming the ship survives the journey.</text>
		<text id="panel2">6/30 - Fleshed out new plan for human augmentation and survivability, including number and type of specimens necessary to achieve our goals. Mr. H has left the research group.</text>
		<text id="panel3">8/5 - Reached target planet but cannot enter atmosphere safely and there are not enough life pods. Probability of survival low, even for augmented subjects. No sign of the enemy.</text>
		<text id="panel4">9/2 - Hull reinforcement progressing, but survival requires augmentation. Dissidents are protesting the procedure, even though their lives depend on it.</text>
		<text id="panel5">9/26 - Can no longer maintain orbit. Many have accepted augmentation, and some who wouldn't were launched in the life pods. Hopefully the reinforcement will be enough for the rest.</text>
		<text id="panel6">10/4 - Emergency reinforcement was largely successful, but estimated number of survivors is far lower than hoped, even considering life pods we cannot account for.</text>
		<text id="panel7">10/5 - Species viability is now a major concern. With only a few hundred individuals, we cannot survive without drastic intervention. Beginning new line of research.</text>
		<text id="panel8">11/20 - Established basic infrastructure east of crash site. Gathering new specimens for experimentation.</text>
		<text id="panel14">12/14 - Species viability research has stalled, but combat research looks promising. Cybernetic enhancements are able to turn an average civilian into a war machine.</text>
		<text id="panel9">12/24 - C disapproves of combat research. Instead of preparing for their return and enhance species viability, C wants to return to the stars and search for other survivors.</text>
		<text id="panel10">1/6 - C left the lab and made it clear we were no longer welcome in town. Moving base of operations into old lab in the remains of sector 22.</text>
		<text id="panel15">1/31 - Applying Cybernetic research to ourselves due to lack of test subjects. Still no sign of the enemy, but perhaps this time we will be able to fight them.</text>
		<text id="panel11">2/9 - Coerced townsfolk to help fund research. Also obtained new test subjects (vagabonds and outcasts). Research is progressing again.</text>
		<text id="panel12">2/27 - Ran out of vagabonds, so had to gather test subjects from the townsfolk. If viability research is not completed soon, we will run out of test subjects again.</text>
